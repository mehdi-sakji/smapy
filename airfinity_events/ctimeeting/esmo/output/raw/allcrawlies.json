However, womens\u2019 adherence to screenings programmes is relatively poor with the average attendance in the EU being below 70%. There are many contributing factors with caregiving for a person with a chronic disease being a significant contributor to poor screening adherence. The purpose of this qualitative research was to investigate informal carers\u2019 knowledge of BC, screening guidelines recommended practices and attitudes about the importance of screening for early detection of BC symptoms. Methods Two small-scale field research activities with expert health professionals and female informal carers from three countries were conducted in the period between December 2019 - March 2020. Participants were recruited according to predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Participant\u2019s perceptions were retrieved from focus groups starting with those with the informal carers. Following informed consent 21 informal carers and 18 professionals participated through purposive sampling. Results The findings revealed several motivational factors and barriers which are at the basis of the lack of preventive practices. The motivational factors that emerged through caregivers personal experiance were: perceived responsibility towards her own family to take care, experiences of close people who died from cancer. The barriers that emerged included: lack of the time to perform Breast self-examination, difficulties going to the hospital due to the caregiving duties, fears and feelings of guilt in dedicating time for oneself. Additional more generic barriers included: lack of knowledge and skills, fear of discovering anomalies/of getting sick, discomfort and pain during the screening tests and forgetting/failing to practice a routine of health prevention. Conclusions This research provided evidence on the ways that the role of informal carer can influence breast cancer preventing practices. The findings highlight the necessity to provide appropriate support to informal carers for better meeting the expectations of the role and allowing the engagement in appropriate preventive practices.

Both cancer related symptoms and the impact of treatment can lead to increasing frailty in this population. The Rockwood CFS is a rapid tool which was originally designed in the 65+ population to assess underlying physiology and chances of functional improvement when older patients are admitted to hospital. When cancer patients are admitted to hospital it can be difficult to assess their fitness, using standard tools such as performance status. The utility of the CFS in cancer inpatients and whether it can be used in patients <65 years is unknown. Methods Clinical Frailty Score was measured as in Rockwood et al (PMID: 16129869 ). The score of 9 (terminal illness) was removed due to concern that a number of patients will be scored in this manner reducing the potential utility. Patients were eligible if they were an inpatient at Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS trust; had a diagnosis of either solid tumour or haematological malignancy and had involvement from the Allied Health Professional Team. Data captured included age, diagnosis, number of medications, place of discharge and survival. Results 237 patients had an assessment from 01/01/2019 to 01/04/2020. 151 patients have died, with a median follow-up of 190 days. Age ranged from 21 to 92 (median 67); 100 patients were <65. CFS significantly predicted survival (P<0.0001) as outlined in the table and the association was maintained in the group <65. Patients with a CFS score <5 had an 86% chance of getting home with appropriate support compared to 58% if CFS >6 (Odds ratio 4.6 (95% CI 2.3 to 9.3): P<0.0001).

Many patients are vulnerable and have long geographical distances to the hospital and physically demanding transport time. Family are challenged to be present due to work, other family obligations and geographical distances. The purpose was to investigate how patients, family and nurses experience video consultations as a substitute for physical attendance, in order to understand if it is feasible to assess clinically via screen and to understand barriers and facilitators. Methods This design was a mixed methods study. Video consultations were implemented in the spring 2019. Patients who had participated in at least one video consultation were asked to fill out questionnaires with socio-economically data about time saved for transport and kilometers saved. Descriptive statistics was used. Qualitative data was collected by semi structured interviews with patients and family caregivers and one focus group interviews with oncology nurses. Analysis of qualitative data was according to content analysis. Results 85/119 patients (71%) responded to the questionnaire. Mean age 66 years (SD 7.8) Most patients were male 59(69.4%). In average patients saved to drive 153 kilometers, range 2-450 km, driving in their own car or public transport, and in average 1-2 hours saved for transport. 15 patients and family caregivers participated in the interviews and 6 nurses in the focus group. Patients experienced freedom and more energy prior to chemotherapy. The consultations took place in a quieter environment, which provided energy for the patient. Family caregivers found it easier to participate in video consultations than physical attendance. The nurses\u2019 experienced a need to learn how to provide nursing by screen and the clinical assessment was challenged by technical problems. Conclusions Older cancer patients experienced freedom and felt more comfortable using video consultations, and family involvement increased. Socioeconomically, video consultation is a success but testing the patient's equipment, technical skills and nursing skills is important in order to make an optimal clinical assessment.

Results Baseline PD-L1 IC was balanced (IC0 43.4%; IC1 37.6%; IC2/3 18.5%), but sTILs and iTILs were higher in CT arm (p=0.046, p=0.005). All baseline biomarkers were significantly associated with pCR in CT/A, but only PD-L1 was in CT arm. Considering log PD-L1 IC (to correct skewness) as continuous variable, OR were 3.42 [1.93-6.07] (p=0.00003) and 1.51 [1.04-2.21], (p=0.032) in CT/A and CT, respectively (interaction p=0.02). pCR for CT/A vs CT (and \u0394pCR) by PD-L1 IC groups were 87.0% vs 72.0% [\u039415%] (IC2/3), 56.2% vs 44.0% [\u039412.2%] (IC1) and 35.1% vs 41.1% [\u0394-6.0%] (IC0). After 1 cycle of treatment (d1c2), tumor cells were not found in 28.8% (CT/A) and 13.6% (CT) (p=0.003), which was predictive of pCR (78.2% vs 42.5%, p<0.0001). TILs increased at d1c2 in both arms (p<0.0001). PD-L1 IC+ did however increase from 45.4% to 74.7% in CT/A (p=0.03) (65.8% change to pos), but decreased from 52.7% to 37.9% in CT (p=0.0001) (44.0% change to neg). In CT/A, also PD-L1 TC+ increased for 2.7% to 36.5%. In both arms, sTILs at d1c2 were more informative than baseline sTILs and \u0394TILs, e.g. in CT/A, sTILs\u226540% had 71.4% pCR (OR 6.38 [2.24-20.9], p=0.0007). Conversion rate of PD-L1 IC baseline to surgery (SX) was 42.9% (- to + 28.6% and + to \u2013 14.3%) and 30.3% (- to + 9.1% and + to \u2013 21.2%) in CT/A and CT arms, respectively. Conclusions Baseline imbalance in sTILs and iTILs might have resulted in smaller differences of pCR between arms. Atezo increased pCR by more than 10% in \u201cimmune-rich\u201d groups (PDL1 IC+, high sTILs/iTILs). PD-L1 dynamic is strong and divergent by arm, with atezo turning most PD-L1 neg to pos. D1c2 assessment provides an early surrogate of pCR, and high rate of tumor absence may suggests that shorter therapy may be enough for some cases.

The GIADA trial (EUDRACT 2016-004665-10) is a phase II study of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, nivolumab and endocrine therapy for Luminal B breast cancer patients. Methods Premenopausal patients with Luminal B breast cancer (HR+/HER2- and G3 or Ki67>20%) candidate to neoadjuvant chemotherapy received: 3 cycles of epirubicin/cyclophosphamide Q3W followed by 8 cycles of nivolumab 240 mg Q2W, triptorelin started concomitantly to chemotherapy and exemestane started concomitantly to nivolumab. To reject the null hypothesis, at least 8/43 pCR (ypT0/is and ypN0) had to be observed. Secondary endpoints included safety and biomarkers. Results 43 patients were included: median age 45y, clinical stage II (81%) and IIIA (19%). All patients started treatment and underwent surgery, 42 received  > 1 nivolumab dose. A pCR was achieved by 7 patients (16.3%; 95%CI 7.4-34.9). Most common Grade  > 3 treatment-related AEs during nivolumab were: GGT (18.6%), ALT (16.3%) and AST (9.3%) increase. Most common immune-related AEs were: hyperthyroidism (18.6%), hypothyroidism (14.0%), skin AEs (11.6%), infusion reactions (4.7%), all Grade 1-2 except a Grade 3 skin AE (erythema nodosus). FFPE tumor samples collected at baseline (t0) and after chemotherapy before nivolumab (t1) were assessed by multiplex immunofluorescence for 18 patients (including 4 patients with pCR). At t0 and t1 pCR vs. non-pCR patients had higher CD3+/PD-1+ (p=0.010, p=0.001), CD4+/FOXP3+ (p=0.025, p=0.004) and CD68+/CD163+ (p=0.015, p=0.026) cells. CD8+ cells increased in pCR patients from t0 to t1 (p=0.001 for pCR vs. non-pCR at t1). Conclusions A neoadjuvant sequence of anthracycline chemotherapy and nivolumab (+ endocrine therapy) induced a 16.3% pCR rate in Luminal B breast cancer patients (primary endpoint not met). Liver toxicity accounted for most Grade  > 3 treatment-related AEs. Baseline and on-treatment characterization of immune infiltrate may identify patients more likely to respond. Residual cancer burden and updated biomaker data will be presented. Clinical trial identification EUDRACT 2016-004665-10.

We explored Eri-based neoadjuvant regimens for primary TNBC patients stratified by homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) and BRCA1/2 germline status in a prospective randomized phase II study. Methods The study enrolled patients with cT1c\u2013T3(<=7 cm), cN0\u2013N1, and M0, TNBC. Patients <65 years old (yo) with HRD+ or BRCA1/2 variant+ cancer were allocated to group A1 (4 cycles of weekly paclitaxel [wP] + carboplatin [Cb] then 4 of A) or A2 (4 cycles of Eri + Cb then 4 of A). Patients >=65 yo, or <65 yo with HRD- were allocated to group B1 (6 cycles of Eri + cyclophosphamide) or B2 (6 cycles of Eri + capecitabine), each with 4 cycles of A for non-responders to the first 4 cycles of Eri-based therapy. Age, tumor size, nodal status and Ki67-LI were stratification factors. Primary endpoint was pCR rate (ypT0-is, ypN0; centrally confirmed). Secondary endpoints were safety, ORR and breast conservation rate (BCR). Results The full analysis set comprised data from all 99 patients enrolled (2/2017-1/2019). Characteristics were similar across groups. In B1 and B2, 48.1% and 55.6%, respectively, completed 6 cycles of an Eri-based regimen.

Neoadjuvant endocrine induction therapy (EIT) suppresses tumor cell proliferation and provides a clinically applicable read-out system for endocrine responsiveness. In a proof-of-principle study, we hypothesized, that incomplete growth suppression following to EIT is associated with genetic alterations in endocrine resistance genes. Methods Genetic alterations in candidate endocrine resistance genes ( ARID1A, CCND1, ERBB2, ESR1, FGFR1, PAK1,  and  TP53 ) [1] were determined by next generation sequencing (NGS) and/or digital PCR (dPCR) in n=622 early BC cases treated with EIT in the West German Study Group (WSG) ADAPT trial (NCT0177920). Further,  PIK3CA  mutation status was determined because of its potential as target to selective inhibition treatment. Significance of association between distinct genetic alterations and incomplete growth suppression (post-EIT Ki67 <10%, versus 10-19%, 20-34%, \u226535%; provisional criteria for this translational research project) was determined with Chi square test for trends. Results A total of n=351/622 (56.4%) BC cases harbored genetic alterations in at least one candidate gene.  ARID1A, ERBB2, ESR1, PIK3CA,  and  TP53  gene mutations were affected in 5.3%, 2.9%, 0.6%, 43.3% and 9.0% of BC cases, respectively.  CCND1, FGFR1,  and  PAK1  copy number gains were detected in 16.1%, 3.0% and 2.5% of tested patient samples. Of these candidate genes tested, only mutation of  TP53  was significantly associated with incomplete growth suppression following EIT (P<0.0001). Mutation of  TP53  was also associated with incomplete growth suppression in patient subsets treated with either tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors for EIT (P=0.0005 each). Conclusions Our findings indicate that mutations associated with endocrine resistance and metastatic breast cancer [1], are enriched in short term endocrine treated primary luminal breast cancers with impaired Ki67 response. Ki67 response towards neoadjuvant endocrine treatment appears to reflect the genetic risk in breast cancer. Clinical trial identification NCT0177920.

The HER2 antibody drug conjugate T-DM1 is highly effective in metastatic and early HER2+ BC. So far, no survival data for de-escalated T-DM1-based (neo)adjuvant regimens without systemic chemotherapy (CT) are available. Here, we present first survival data from ADAPT-TP. Methods The prospective WSG-ADAPT-TP phase II-trial is part of the ADAPT-umbrella protocol (NCT  NCT01779206 ): 375 patients (pts) with HR+/HER2+ BC were randomized to 12 weeks of T-DM1 +/- standard ET and trastuzumab+ET q3w (ratio 1:1:1). Primary endpoint was pCR (ypT0/is/ypN0) (previously published: T-DM1/T-DM1+ET/T+ET: 41%/42%/15%). Secondary endpoints: safety, 5-y DFS, OS, translational research. Omission of further CT was allowed in all pts with pCR after 12-weeks study therapy. Results After median follow-up of 5 years, no significant differences between study arms were observed regarding DFS (T-DM1/T-DM1+ET/T+ET 5-y rate: 88.9%, 85.3%, and 84.6%) and OS (97.2%, 96.4% and 96.3%). pCR (vs. non-pCR) after the 12-week study treatment was strongly associated with improved DFS (5y DFS 92.7% vs. 82.7, HR=0.40, 95% CI 0.18-0.85). Among 117 pts with pCR, no further CT was given in 41 pts (35%). Significant differences between CT-treated vs. non-treated pCR pts regarding baseline characteristics were only observed for age (median 50y vs. 56y, p=0.005); similar 5y DFS was observed in both groups (92.1% (95%-CI: 78-97%) vs. 93% (84-97%)). Only 3 deaths occurred in pts with pCR. Conclusions Early pCR after 12 weeks of therapy was strongly associated with improved outcome in ADAPT TP and may serve as a predictive marker for CT treatment (de)-escalation. Despite substantially higher pCR rates, T-DM1 +/- ET was not associated with different DFS or OS vs. T+ET, most likely due to standard CT, given to all non-pCR pts and most pCR pts or small sample size of study. Excellent 93% 5y DFS in pts with pCR after only 12 weeks of T-DM1 +/- ET (even w/o further CT) is promising and may serve as a basis for further prospective trials addressing omission of CT overtreatment in carefully selected patients with HER2+ early BC.

Methods Pts completed neoadjuvant PH + chemotherapy + surgery and were randomised 1:1 to 3 cycles of PH IV followed by 3 cycles of PH FDC SC or vice-versa (crossover period). Pts then chose SC or IV to continue EBC tx up to 18 cycles (continuation period). Primary objective: to assess pt preference for PH FDC SC. Key secondary objectives: patient satisfaction, healthcare professional (HCP) perceptions on time/resource impact, and safety. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03674112. Results At primary analysis, 160 pts were randomised; all pts completed crossover tx; 44% completed continuation tx at cut-off (24-02-20). 136 pts (85%; 95% CI 79\u201390%) preferred SC; 22 (14%) preferred IV; 2 (1%) had no preference. Main reasons for SC preference: reduced clinic time (n=119) and comfort during administration (n=73). 141 (88%) were very satisfied or satisfied with SC vs. 108 (68%) with IV. 87% chose SC to complete HER2-targeted therapy. HCPs\u2019 perceptions on median pts\u2019 time in the tx room across cycles 1\u20136 for SC vs. IV admin were 33\u201350 vs. 130\u2013300 min, respectively. The rates of serious adverse events (AEs) and grade \u22653 AEs were low; the most common AEs were as expected (table). There were a higher number of injection site reactions with SC, mainly grade 1\u20132. AE rates before and after switching were similar (PH IV\u2192PH FDC SC: 78%\u219273%; PH FDC SC\u2192PH IV: 78%\u219264%), with no new safety signals.

TROIKA is a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, equivalence, multicentre Phase III study designed to compare the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity of HD201 to Herceptin in patients with HER2 positive early breast cancer (EBC). Methods 503 patients with HER2+ EBC were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either HD201 or Herceptin in neoadjuvant settings for 8 cycles in combination with chemotherapy (4 cycles of docetaxel followed by 4 cycles of epirubicin/cyclophosphamide). The patients then underwent surgery followed by 10 cycles of HD201 or Herceptin monotherapy. The primary objective was to demonstrated equivalence in total pathologic complete response (tpCR) rate between treatments. The pre-specified equivalence margins were +/- 15% for the 95% confidence interval of the absolute difference for tpCR rates. Secondary endpoints including breast pathologic complete response (bpCR), overall response rate (ORR), event-free survival (EFS), PK, immunogenicity, and safety were assessed. Results The tpCR rates were 46.60% and 46.20% for HD201 and Herceptin respectively. The difference of tpCR rate was 0.50% and the 95% CI was -8.6% - 9.6%, both contained within the pre-defined equivalence margins. Secondary endpoints were similar between HD201 and Herceptin. The bpCR rate of 55.00% and 53.40% and the ORR of 90.80% and 89.40% for HD201 and Herceptin respectively. Safety was comparable between HD201 and Herceptin during neoadjuvant period. PK equivalence was demonstrated with mean steady-state C trough  levels of 53.72 ug/mL in the HD201 group and 51.64 ug/mL in the Herceptin group at the onset of Cycle 8, providing a 4.0% [-2.6%; 10.6%] on the mean relative difference between the two treatments within the pre-specified interval [-20%;+20%]. Interim data indicate comparable immunogenicity between HD201 and Herceptin. Conclusions Equivalence in efficacy, safety, PK and immunogenicity profiles was demonstrated between HD201 and Herceptin. TROIKA is currently in its follow up phase. Complete safety, immunogenicity and survival data are to follow. Clinical trial identification Eudract: 2016-004019-11.

Most of them did not overtly declare non-adherence. We now evaluate the longitudinal evolution of non-adherence to TAM by using serum assessment and pts\u2019 self-declarations at year 3 (Y3). Methods CANTO COMPLETE, a sub-study of CANTO cohort ( NCT01993498),  evaluates prevalence and predictors of non-adherence to adjuvant endocrine therapy in premenopausal pts at several time points from treatment initiation by drug serum levels and pts\u2019 self-declarations. TAM was measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry on 50 \u03bcL of serum (lower limit of quantification [LLOQ]= 10 ng/mL). Pts were considered as biochemically non-adherent if TAM <60 ng/mL. Pts\u2019 declarations were collected at the same time points. We used multivariable logistic regression and longitudinal multivariable mixed models to evaluate non-adherence at Y3. Results 718 pts were evaluable at Y3. Median age 46 (IQR 42\u201349), partnered 536 (78.7%), post-graduation education 362 (52.6%), stage I BC 333 (46.4%) and received chemotherapy 444 (61.8%). At Y3, serum assessment showed that 260 (36.2%) pts were non-adherent, of whom 226 (31.5%) with TAM <LLOQ. By matching with pts\u2019 declarations: 118 out of 260 (45.4%) did not report non-adherence. The table below reports the longitudinal evolution of biochemical adherence. Regression model showed that younger age (adjusted (a) OR for 1 year increase in age= 0.94 [95% CI 0.91-0.98]) and hot flashes at Y1 (aOR = 1.62 [1.03-2.54]) were associated to biochemical non-adherence.

SABCS 2019). Here, we evaluated the pCR rates in different subgroups and in relation to RANK expression. Methods 780 patients (pts) with high risk early BC were randomized 2x2 first to +/- Dmab (120mg sc q4w/6 cycles) and then to two different nP regimen (nP 125mg/m 2  q1w or d1, 8 q22) followed by EC (q2w or q3w) stratified by subtype, sTILs and EC regimen. Carboplatin was given in triple-negative (TNBC) and anti-HER2-therapy in HER2+ BC. RANK was stained on pre-therapeutic core biopsies (n=667) with the antibody RANK/Envision System HRP (DAB) and was analyzed immunohistochemically for percentage of membranous tumor cell staining (RANK high if >5 %). Results RANK expression was high in 20.8% of biopsies. It correlated with younger age (< 40 yrs: 15.5% low vs. 32.4% high; p<0.001), HR-status (ER and PR negative: 40.7% low vs. 69.1% high; p<0.001), tumor grade (G3: 63.6% low vs. 74.8 % high; p=0.03), Ki67 (>20%: 80.7% low vs. 91.4 % high; p=0.002) and stromal (s) TILs (>50% sTILs: 7.4% low vs. 10.8% high; p=0.002). High RANK expression resulted in a significantly higher pCR rate than RANK low (49.6% vs. 39.4%; p=0.037). But this was not associated with Dmab effect (RANK high: OR with vs. without Dmab 0.864 [90% CI 0.494-1.51], p=0.67; RANK low: OR 1.10 [90% CI 0.821-1.48], p=0.59; p interaction=0.53). pCR rates (ypT0 ypN0) are shown in the table.

Therefore, we have developed and validated contrast\u2013enhanced multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radiomic-based signatures for preoperative identification of ALN metastasis and assessment of individual disease-free survival (DFS) in early breast cancer. Methods In this multicentre, retrospective, cohort study, we included early stage breast cancer patients from four hospitals in China, which were divided randomly (7:3) into the development and validation cohorts. Radiomic features were extracted from preoperative MR imaging. LASSO and random forest algorithm were applied to select key radiomic features from the development cohort. Two nomograms incorporating radiomic and clinical signatures were developed to predict ALN status and individual DFS, respectively, based on multivariable logistic or radiomics signature penalized Cox regression models. Results 218,729 MRI images from 1,214 individuals were included. The ALN radiomic nomogram accurately predicted ALN metastasis in the development cohort (Area Under Curve, [AUC] = 0.92), validation cohort (AUC = 0.90), and entire cohort (AUC = 0.91). The DFS radiomic nomogram could discriminate high- from low risk patients in the development, validation, and entire cohort (HR for all 0.04,  P  < 0.001). The radiomic nomogram was strongly correlated with 3-year DFS in the development cohort (AUC = 0.89), validation cohort (AUC = 0.90) and entire cohort (AUC = 0.89). Subgroup analysis showed that these nomograms had excellent and highly-generalized predictive ability for ALN metastasis and DFS. Conclusions This study used the largest database to date to describe the application of MRI-based artificial intelligence in patients with breast cancer, presenting novel individualized clinical-decision radiomic nomograms that could precisely predict ALN metastasis and DFS.

Methods The LiTS-Challenge dataset [1] containing 91 CT scans with different types of liver lesions was used for training. A U-Net based model adapted with three-channel input and aggregated residual transformations [2] to extract important features was trained on the axial slices. The first channel input contained slice with intensities clipped to the interval [375,425] HU. The second channel input contained slice with intensities normalized between -1000 and 400 HU. As an input to the third channel, histogram equalization was applied on the normalized axial slice. The model was optimized based on its predictions at multiple resolution levels (512, 256 and 128) which encouraged the network to predict correctly not only at the last layer, but also at deep layers with low resolution output. The performance of the model was evaluated on an external validation dataset from Maastricht University Medical Centre (MUMC) containing 170 patients with liver metastases of colorectal origin. The reference ground truth delineation was provided by a trained medical doctor. Results The proposed model achieved an average dice score coefficient (DSC) of 0.72, an average sensitivity of 85% and an average False Positive Rate (FPR) <1% compared to manual delineation. Automated segmentation took on an average, 10s per case on a GTX 1070 GPU while it took around 15 min for manual segmentation. Conclusions We present a novel auto-segmentation solution based on routine clinical imaging of metastatic liver cancer patients. The performance of the network is in line with human experts. The solution increases efficiency via swifter reporting times, especially in clinical and image analysis workflows. Finally, this automated solution can be used to obtain information on the changes in the tumor size in response to treatment which can be compared with RECIST estimates used in clinical practice.

However, to date no clinical level of evidence 1 has been provided for any of the many radiomics signatures published in the literature. The purpose of this study is to provide that evidence by prospectively validating a prognostic radiomics signature for chemoradiotherapy lung cancer patients [1]. Methods A total of 228 chemoradiotherapy lung cancer patients were collected from the observational SDC lung clinical trial (NCT01855191). Tumour volumes within the CT scans of these patients were segmented automatically using a deep learning model (validated DICE agreement with oncologists of 0.88) and used as input to the radiomics signature. The primary outcome was overall survival. The signature was used to classify patients as responders or non-responders (high/low score based on of the threshold proposed by Aerts et al.). Predefined statistical tests were performed to prospectively validate the performance of the model. Results Discrimination of the model was assessed by Harrell\u2019s concordance index (c-index = 0.64; 95% CI: 0.59-0.70). Kaplan-Meier survival curves differed significantly between responders/non-responders (log-rank test; p = 0.002). The calibration slope (\u03b2) on the linear predictor of the signature in a Cox proportional hazards model was 1.27 (H0: \u03b2 = 1, p = 0.37), indicating a valid relative risk model. A joint test of the coefficients of the individual variables of the signature (p = 0.028) indicated that the performance in the prospective validation cohort could be improved by adjusting the model coefficients. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge this study demonstrates the first clinical evidence level 1 for any radiomics signature. This has implications for the wider field as it demonstrates that other signatures could also be prospectively validated. This signature could be practically used as a clinical decision support tool to evaluate the likelihood of response to chemoradiotherapy, or as a stratification tool in future clinical trials.

Intratumoral administration is a potential solution to limit these events by reducing systemic exposure while increasing local concentration in the tumor. The active agent is typically required to stay in contact with the tumor. This requires attachment directly into the tumor or to the surrounding tissue. Dendrimers are well-defined, multivalent molecules having branched structure of nanometer size, which can be used to form injectable gels. Dendrimers have been used to encapsulate and release drugs with the aid of external stimuli at physiological pH. Methods We prepared a dendrimeric drug delivery matrix based on a PEG-core. The model drug (5-fluorouracil, docetaxel, capecitabine, cisplatin) was encapsulated in the matrix. The outer shell of the matrix was modified with photoreactive groups, injected inside the tumor, and attached to the tumor by activation of the photoreactive groups with the aid of interstitial photodynamic therapy. We compared the pharmacokinetics, tissue distribution and antitumor efficacy of conventional systemic therapy and the intratumoral therapy in xenograft-bearing mice. The tumor growth curve was plotted and tumor, spleen, lymph nodes, and lungs were collected at the study endpoint for further flow cytometry and histological analysis. Results The dendrimer-based therapy showed significantly decreased tumor growth rates over standard systemic therapies. Mice treated with the intratumoral dendrimer showed decreased toxicity when compared to those receiving systemic therapies. The matrix enabled a significant increase in drug accumulation in tumors, and markedly extended the survival of mice compared with conventional systemic treatments. Conclusions Local sustained intratumoral systemic therapy is a potential strategy for improving treatment of solid tumors while minimizing adverse side effects. The photoreactive dendrimer matrix enhances antitumor activity by improving intratumoral drug accumulation and increases efficacy in comparison to conventional systemic therapies. These results highlight the potential use of photoreactive dendrimers in the treatment of several cancer types. Legal entity responsible for the study Chembrain LTD.

These mice develop mismatch-repair deficient (MMR-D) tumours spontaneously. Repetitive therapeutic application of a whole tumour lysate prolonged overall survival along with reduced tumour burden. Assessment of tumour microenvironment not only revealed infiltration of CD8 +  T-cells and granulocytes, but also upregulation of immune checkpoint molecules (LAG-3, PD-L1), likely constituting an escape mechanism. We therefore conducted a combined immunotherapeutic approach. Methods In this ongoing trial, MLH1-knockout mice with established gastrointestinal tumours received single or three injections of 6E11 (anti PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, 2.5 mg/kg bw, i.v.) either alone or in combination with the vaccine. Tumour growth was monitored by longitudinal PET/CT imaging, immune activation was analyzed via flow cytometric immune monitoring. Results 6E11 monotherapy slightly increased median overall survival (mOS: 6.0 weeks vs. control 3.5 weeks). By increasing the injection intervals (3 injections, same dose), therapy outcome was improved (mOS: 9.2 weeks) and additionally boosted by combining 6E11 with the vaccine (mOS: 20 weeks vs. 10.2 weeks vaccine monotherapy). Accompanying PET/CT imaging confirmed tumour growth control in all treatment arms, with strongest growth inhibition in the combination group and complete remission in two cases resulting in long-term survival (>30 weeks) without evidence of tumour recurrence. Effects were accompanied by decreased levels of circulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells, PD-1, CTLA-4 and LAG-3-positive cells as well as and increased levels of cytotoxic T cells in spleens and residual tumours. Conclusions By successful uncoupling of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, we provide further evidence for the safe and successful application of immunotherapies to combat MMR-D-driven malignancies, which warrants further investigation.

Nevertheless, tumours of the same stage are heterogeneous with respect to aggressiveness and outcome. Therefore we aimed to study whether CD163+ tumour-infiltrating macrophages, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, tumour-stroma ratio and tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes can provide supplementary prognostic information. Methods 44 consecutive cases of surgically resected OSCC without neoadjuvant therapy were selected. Paraffin sections of the tumours were immunohistochemically stained for CD163 (Clone MRQ-26) and PD-L1 (clone 22C3). Numbers of CD163+ macrophages were counted, and PD-L1 tumour proportion score, immune cells score and combined positive score were determined. Tumour/stroma ratio and tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes were evaluated on haematoxylin-eosin stained sections. Results In multivariate analysis including classical prognostic factors, high numbers of CD163+ macrophages were associated with worse overall survival (\u2264 24 months) (OR: 6.49; 95% CI: 1.04-40.60; p=0.045). PD-L1 tumour proportion score \u2265 5% was also associated with worse overall survival (OR: 9.67; 95% CI: 1.30-71.64; p=0.026) whereas no association between PD-L1 immune cells score or combined positive score and overall survival was observed. Moreover, tumour/stroma ratio \u2265 50% was associated with worse overall survival (OR: 25.97; 95% CI: 1.83-368.18; p=0.016). No association between tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and survival was detected. Conclusions In our well-defined cohort of oral squamous cell carcinomas, a high number of CD163+ tumour-infiltrating macrophages, a PD-L1 tumour proportion score \u2265 5% and a tumour/stroma ratio \u2265 50% are independent prognostic factors for overall survival \u2264 24 months.

EGFR  is mutated in roughly 10-30% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Although several EGFR tyrosine kinases inhibitors (TKI) are developed to treat tumours which possess an EGFR sensitizing mutation, primary and secondary resistance to EGFR TKIs arise due to different mechanisms, such as T790M mutation or hyperactivation of transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). We and other authors have described the overexpression of fatty acid synthase (FASN), an enzyme responsible for endogenous synthesis of long-chain fatty acids, as a resistance mechanism. Therefore, in this work we studied the effect of a novel FASN inhibitor compound AZ12756122 in EGFR mutated (EGFRm) NSCLC sensitive and resistant to EGFR-TKIs. Methods Cell models used were EGFRm lung adenocarcinoma sensitive to EGFR-TKIs (PC9), two derived T790M+ gefitinib resistant models (PC9-GR1 and PC9-GR4) and T790M- cells resistant to both gefitinib and osimertinib (PC9-GR3). Cell proliferation was assessed through the MTT assay, FASN activity by counting radiolabelled fatty acids synthesized  de novo , gene expression and signalling pathways related to FASN/EGFR were evaluated by means of qRT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. Besides, the interaction of AZ12756122 with EGFR TKIs (gefitinib or osimertinib) was determined in resistant cell models using the CompuSyn TM  software. Results AZ12756122 treatment showed a cytotoxic effect in all cell models analysed exhibiting a reduction of FASN activity, gene expression, and protein levels. Moreover, a decrease of phosphorylated levels of EGFR and STAT3 has been observed after AZ12756122 treatment in sensitive and gefitinib-resistant cell models. The combination of AZ12756122 with osimertinib exhibited synergistic effects in PC9-GR3 cell model. Conclusions We show cytotoxic effect of the inhibition of FASN by AZ12756122 in EGFRm NSCLC cell models. Our results suggest the combinatorial inhibition of FASN/EGFR/STAT3 signalling pathway as a promising therapeutic option to overcome the resistance to EGFR TKI treatment for further  in vivo  experiments.

Insufficient efficiency of the used adjuvant radiochemotherapy might be related to its side-effects on the normal surrounding brain tissue, resulting in the formation of a microenvironmental niche for recurrent tumour growth. Here, we studied the functional effects of therapy on the normal brain extracellular matrix (ECM) and tumour growth in mouse GBM relapse models. Methods To model GBM relapse, mouse brain was multiple irradiated (7 Gy/day for 3 days) or the animals were treated with chemotherapeutic drug temozolomide (TMZ) (150 mg/m2) and/or dexamethasone (DXM) (1 mg/kg) for 6 weeks followed by inoculation of GBM U87 cells into the brain in vivo. Orthotropic tumour growth rate was analysed by MRI. Brain ECM composition, and structure was analysed by RT-PCR and IHC. Adhesion, proliferation and invasion of U87 cells on the treated and non-treated organotypic hippocampal slices were studied using co-culture system ex vivo. Results Both X-ray irradiation and TMZ/DXM significantly affected the expression of key brain ECM glycosylated components proteoglycans. The changed ECM composition was associated with the increased tumour growth and invasive capacity of GBM cells in the mice received TMZ and/or DXM (2,5-fold) compared with the control animals in vivo. Organotypic slices from the irradiated mouse brain or from mice treated with the drugs were more susceptible to the increased adhesion (by DXM), proliferation (by TMZ) or invasion (by irradiation) of U87 cells during co-culture ex vivo. Combined treatment with TMZ/DXM increased adhesion, proliferation and invasion of U87 cells into the organotypic slices, whereas non-treated brain tissue did not possess these effects. Conclusions Anti-glioblastoma radiochemotherapy significantly affects normal brain ECM structure creating a favourable niche for GBM cells proliferation and invasion and potentially contributing to GBM relapse development.

Our previous research has shown that SENP1 could be a potential tumour-promoting factor in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, its role in tumour progression remains largely unknown. This study aims to characterize the role of SENP1 in lung adenocarcinoma. Methods The TCGA database provided us expression profiles of SENP1 and overall survival rates. loss-of-function assays were performed to examine the effect of SENP1 on proliferation, migration and invasion of lung adenocarcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Immunoprecipitation (IP), western blot and quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) were carried out to reveal the interrelation between SENP1, SIRT6 and AAT (amino acid transporter) genes signal pathway. Results In this study, we found that SENP1 was expressed at high levels in lung adenocarcinoma tissues and advanced TNM stages and was significantly associated with poor prognosis. we also found that SENP1 knockdown inhibited lung adenocarcinoma cell progression in vitro and in vivo. SUMOylation of SIRT6 was also observed in lung adenocarcinoma, and it was reduced by SENP1. SUMOylation of SIRT6 specifically increased its deacetylation of histone H3 on lysine 56 instead of that of lysine 9 (H3K9) in an in vitro model. Mechanistically, we found that knockdown of SENP1 reduced the expression of AAT genes by decreasing H3K56 acetylation through increasing SIRT6 SUMOylation. Moreover, mutation of the SUMOylation sites of Sirt6 reduced its tumour-suppressive effects. Conclusions These results revealed that SENP1 promotion of tumour progression in lung adenocarcinoma and its tumour-promoting effects might be attributed to its important role in the regulation of Sirt6 SUMOylation and the expression of AAT genes.

However, whether they arise from pre-existing populations after selection or are the result of metabolic adaptation of differentiated cells is still under debate. By individually silencing AKT isoforms in pancreatic adenocarcinoma we have observed the acquisition of stem-cell characteristics, with sharp differences between each isoform. Methods We have individually silenced AKT isoforms using short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) delivered by lentivirus. When cells adapted to the modification, high-throughput quantitative proteomics analyses were performed to evaluate the differentially altered molecular routes. We have evaluated accepted CSCs features as mitochondrial mass and metabolism, CD44 and EpCAM expression, ALDH activity, NANOG expression, spheroid growth and autophagy. We have generated constitutively active and dominant negative c-MYC pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines. Results The adaptation induced deep proteomic changes that affected cells differently depending on the AKT isoform silenced. c-MYC was the main transcription factor associated to potential regulation of the proteomes induced by the silencing of AKT isoforms. c-MYC expression was downregulated in shAKT1 expressing cell line. Mitochondrial mass was increased in the 3 isoforms, although only shAKT1 had greater mitochondrial respiration. Higher basal autophagy was observed in shAKT1 and shAKT3 compared with shAKT2 and control, as well as spheroid formation, regarding both number and size. An increase in NANOG was apparent in shAKT1. CD44 and EpCAM co-expression was increased only in shAKT1, while it was abrogated in c-MYC T58A expressing cell line. Conclusions The silencing of each AKT isoform induce distinct degrees of CSC dedifferentiation in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. c-MYC is a main regulator of this process.

Palbociclib is an oral selective inhibitor of the CDKs 4 and 6. EC endometrioid adenocarcinoma is hormone dependent and endocrine therapy with aromatase inhibitors is well established. This is the first randomised trial of a CDK4/6 inhibitor (P) vs placebo combined with L in pts with advanced or recurrent ER+ EC. Methods Eligible pts had ECOG PS 0/1, histologically confirmed endometrioid EC that was ER+ and measurable or evaluable per RECIST v1.1 and had received no prior CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy. Prior surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy or \u22641 line of endocrine therapy (MPA/megestrol acetate) was permitted. Pts were stratified according to number of prior chemotherapy lines, prior endocrine therapy and measurable vs evaluable disease. Pts were randomised 1:1 to receive L 2.5 mg OD orally d1\u201328 with either palbociclib 125 mg or placebo OD orally d1\u201321 in a 28-d cycle until progression. Tumours were assessed every 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Results Of 77 enrolled pts, 73 were evaluable (2 received no trial drug; 1 had brain metastases; 1 withdrew consent before starting treatment): 37 randomised to L + placebo and 36 to L + palbociclib combination. Major comorbidity: diabetes in 12%, hypertension in 41%. 88% had relapsed disease and only 15% had prior MPA/megestrol acetate. Palbociclib/placebo was interrupted in 25/ 8 pts and in 14 pts the dose of palbociclib was reduced. L + palbociclib significantly improved PFS compared with L + placebo: median 8.3 vs. 3.0 months, respectively; hazard ratio 0.56 (95% CI 0.32 to 0.98; p0.041). Disease control rate at 24 weeks: 64% vs. 38%. Treatment-emergent grade 3/4 adverse events were significantly more frequent with L + palbociclib (anaemia 8% vs 3%; neutropenia 42% vs 0%). Patient-reported outcomes were similar in the two treatment arms.

Namely, a combination of extensive surgical dissection in the pelvis followed by pelvic radiotherapy is associated with higher morbidity. Goal of ABRAX multicentric, retrospective, cohort study was to determine whether the completion of radical hysterectomy improves oncological outcome of such patients. Methods A total of 515 cervical cancer patients, who intraoperatively turned to be LN positive, referred for primary surgery with a curative intent between 2005 and 2015 (stage IA-IIB, common tumour types) were retrospectively analysed in 51 institutions from 19 countries. LNs with metastasis \u22652 mm were considered positive (N1). Completion (COMPL group, n=361) or abandonment (ABAND group, n=154) of planned uterine surgery stratified the cohort in two subgroups in which oncological outcomes and major prognostic factors were evaluated. 91.4% of COMPL group underwent adjuvant chemoradiation, 100% of ABAND group were treated with primary chemoradiation. Results Disease free survival reached 74% (381/515) in the whole cohort with the median follow-up of 48.9 months. Both groups (ABAND and COMPL) were balanced in main prognostic factors (tumour size, tumour type, stage of disease). No significant difference was found between the groups in the risk of recurrence (HR=1.154; p=0.446), local recurrence (HR=0.836; p=0.557), or death (HR=1.064; p=0.779). Subgroup analyses did not identify any cohort with survival benefit from radical surgery completion. Increasing FIGO stage and tumour size \u22654 cm were identified as major prognostic factors for recurrence and survival in the whole cohort. Conclusions ABRAX trial revealed that completion of radical hysterectomy in patients with intraoperative detection of positive lymph node does not improve the survival; recurrence risk is not decreased irrespective of tumour size or tumour type. Therefore, if pelvic LN involvement is diagnosed at surgery, abandonment of planned uterine procedure should be considered and the patient should be referred to definitive chemoradiation.

We aimed to prospectively assess the efficacy and safety of niraparib with an individualized starting dose (ISD) in Chinese patients. Methods NORA trial was conducted in 32 hospitals in China. Eligible patients were women with PSROC who had either germline  BRCA  mutation or high-grade serious histologic features and who had a complete or partial response after completion of the last round of platinum therapy. Patients were randomly allocated (2:1) to receive oral niraparib or placebo once daily. The starting dose was individualized (ISD) per baseline body weight and platelet count (200 mg for patients with baseline body weight < 77 kg or platelet count < 150,000/\u03bcL; otherwise, 300 mg). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review. Results From September 26 2017 to February 2 2019, 265 patients were randomized to niraparib (n=177) or placebo (n=88); 16 patients received fixed starting dose of 300 mg and 249 patients received an ISD (300 mg, n=14; 200 mg, n=235) under the amended protocol. The median PFS was significantly longer for patients on niraparib versus placebo; 18.3 (95% CI, 10.9, not evaluable) versus 5.4 (95% CI, 3.7, 5.7) months (HR=0.32; 95% CI, 0.23\u20130.45; p <0.0001).

Methods Patients (pts) with recurrent ovarian cancer (ROC) and a platinum-free interval (TFIp) between 6-12 months (mos) were randomized to the combination of trabectedin (1.1 mg/m 2 ) and PLD (30 mg/ m 2 ) or carboplatin (AUC 5) and PLD (30 mg/ m 2 ). Results From 2014 to 2017, we enrolled 617 pts from 117 European sites (306 CP arm, 311 TP arm). The median TFIp was 8.4 mos and 30% of pts received 2 previous platinum lines. The treatment was interrupted before the sixth cycle in 28% of pts in CP arm (70% for progression/death, 15% for toxicity and 5% for patient refusal) and in 46% in TP arm (54% for progression/death, 19% for toxicity and 13% for patient refusal). 75% and 74% of pts received a subsequent therapy (ST) in CP and TP arm respectively; in TP arm 86% of ST was platinum-based. At a median follow-up of 44 mos, 466 deaths were observed. The median OS was 21.3 and 21.5 mos in CP and TP arm (HR=1.10; 95%CI: 0.92-1.32; p=0.284). The median progression free survival (PFS) was 9.0 and 7.5 mos in CP and TP arm (HR=1.26 95%CI: 1.07-1.49; p=0.005). In pts receiving a ST, the HR for PFS from the ST was 0.84 (95%CI: 0.70-1.02, p=0.086) in favor of TP. Subgroup analyses (according to BRCA status, extent of the disease, number of previous lines, histology, ST) did not identify subsets of pts with a clear benefit from TP. Grade 3-5 (g3-5) adverse reactions (ARs) occurred in 36% and 69% of pts in CP and TP arm. G3-5 most frequent ARs were hematological (28% CP, 45% TP), gastrointestinal (7% CP, 18% TP), hepatic (1% CP, 18% TP); any grade neurotoxicity was 16% for both arms. Conclusions This study did not meet its primary endpoint of improving OS with the TP regimen followed by platinum over CP regimen. However, as TP reached similar OS, it can still be considered in pts who need a longer recovery time from platinum specific toxicities. Clinical trial identification NCT01379989.

We aim to describe cancer patient experiences related to the COVID-19 pandemic in Switzerland. Information gained through in-depths interviews will be triangulated with the level of distress and resilience. Methods Purposive sampling will be used to recruit four patient subgroups diagnosed with melanoma, breast, lung, or colon cancer (i) under adjuvant treatment; (ii) under anti-cancer treatment with palliative intent; (iii) being consulted at institutes for complementary and integrative medicine (ICIM); (iv) being consulted by clinical nurse specialists (CNS). Interview guides were developed based on qualitative analysis of public online cancer patients\u2019 forums from four different countries. We selected main posts related to COVID-19. Semantic and inductive thematic analysis approaches were used to identify meaningful patterns and themes. The level of distress and resilience will be measured by the NCCN Distress Thermometer and the 2-item Connor-Davidson-Resilience Scale. We aim to include 120 patients (10 participants per subgroup in each language region). Recruitment will start in September 2020. Results The design of the study as well as preliminary data regarding themes and subthemes identified in the patient\u2019s forum analysis will be presented. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, no patient experience study with a qualitative design is conducted or planned with cancer patients during COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. The study will serve to identify concerns, unmet information and clinical needs and potential positive experiences of patients with cancer in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Newly developed patient reported measures should be based on qualitative data. The identification of topics considered important to patients will thus support the development of patient reported experience measures for the current or future epidemics/pandemics.

The request to stay at home particularly applied to cancer patients, who were considered at higher risk for infection and severe events. Patients had to experience substantial psychosocial implications of mass quarantine and they were also faced with special challenges to receive safe cancer care. This study aimed to investigate the perspectives of people living with cancer during mass quarantine. Methods The Italian Association of Cancer Nurses (AIIAO) conducted an online survey from March 29 th  to May 3 rd , 2020, which corresponds to \u2018Phase One\u2019 of the COVID-19 Italian emergency plan. People living with cancer and self-isolated at home were invited to fill in the survey via social groups. Data about socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, opinion on the impact of SARS-CoV-2, access to cancer care, behavioural measures implemented, and the perception of being isolated (ISOLA scale) were collected. Results Participants were 195 adults living with cancer (female=76%, mean age=50.3\u00b111.2 years). They were more often affected by haematological malignancy (51.3%) and staying at home with partner and children (38.5%) for more than 4 weeks (70.8%). Only 54% of them believed to be at higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and 51% for severe complications. Measures to prevent the infection included hand washing (95.2%), social distancing (81.5%), face mask (96.3%), gloves (55.6%), and remedies to boost their immune system (29%). Overall, 62% reported diminished/absent access to cancer care and 29% were afraid that their cancer was not under control. The mean scores of the ISOLA scale (range 1-5) were 2.64 (SD=0.81) for isolation-related suffering, 3.31 (SD=1.13) for problems in the relationship with others, and 3.14 (SD=1.06) for difficulties in the relationship with oneself. Greater social isolation in quarantine was reported by the older patients, with lower education, and living without children. Conclusions In the context of grave threats to their physical and mental health, people living with cancer need help from nurses to prioritise their health, cope with isolation-related suffering, and identify effective preventive behaviours.

ATTRACTION-4 is a randomized, multicenter, phase 2/3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nivolumab plus chemotherapy vs. chemotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with HER2-negative, advanced or recurrent G/GEJ cancer. Here we report the results of the double-blind phase III part. Methods Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive nivolumab plus chemotherapy (N+C, S-1 plus oxaliplatin or capecitabine plus oxaliplatin) or placebo plus chemotherapy (C). Nivolumab or placebo was intravenously administered every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Tumor assessment was performed every 6 weeks through week 54, then repeated every 12 weeks. The co-primary endpoints were centrally-assessed PFS and OS, and it was prespecified that the primary objective is deemed to be achieved if at least one of the null hypotheses of the primary endpoints is rejected. Results A total of 724 Asian patients were randomized to N+C (n=362) or C (n=362) between Mar 7, 2017, and May 10, 2018. At the interim analysis primary for PFS with the median follow-up period of 11.6 mo, PFS was significantly improved in N+C vs. C (HR 0.68; 98.51% CI 0.51-0.90; p=0.0007; median PFS, 10.5 vs. 8.3 mo), meeting the primary endpoint. At the final analysis primary for OS with the median follow-up period of 26.6 mo, there was no statistically significant difference (HR 0.90; 95% CI 0.75-1.08; p=0.257; median OS, 17.5 vs. 17.2 mo), while PFS was continuously longer in N+C than in C. ORR was higher in N+C than in C (57.5 vs. 47.8%; p=0.0088). The incidences of grade 3 to 5 treatment-related adverse events were 57.9% in N+C and 49.2% in C. Conclusions PFS was significantly improved in N+C vs. C, achieving the primary objective. The combination of nivolumab and chemotherapy, which demonstrated clinically meaningful efficacy in PFS and ORR with a manageable safety profile but not statistically significant improvement in OS, can be considered a new first-line treatment option in advanced or recurrent G/GEJ cancer.

Methods Eligible pts were randomized 1:1 to pembro 200 mg or placebo Q3W for up to 2 yr + chemo (cisplatin 80 mg/m2 Q3W [d1; 6 doses] + 5-FU 800 mg/m2\u00a0on d1-5 Q3W). Randomization was stratified by Asia vs Rest of World, adenocarcinoma vs ESCC, and ECOG PS 0 vs 1. Treatment continued until progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal, or 2 yr. No crossover was permitted. Primary end points were OS in pts with ESCC PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) \u226510 tumors, and OS and PFS (RECIST v1.1 ; by investigator) in ESCC, PD-L1 CPS \u226510, and all pts. The secondary end point was ORR (RECIST v1.1; by investigator) in all pts. Data cutoff for interim OS/final PFS analysis was July 2, 2020. Results At data cutoff, 749 pts (83% male, 73% ESCC) were randomized (373 pembro + chemo; 376 chemo). Median follow-up was 10.8 mo. Pembro + chemo vs chemo was superior for OS in pts with ESCC CPS \u226510 (median 13.9 vs 8.8 mo; HR 0.57; 95% CI, 0.43-0.75;\u00a0 P  < 0.0001), ESCC (median 12.6 vs 9.8 mo; HR 0.72; 95% CI, 0.60-0.88; P\u00a0= 0.0006), CPS \u226510 (median 13.5 vs 9.4 mo; HR 0.62; 95% CI, 0.49-0.78;\u00a0 P  < 0.0001), and all pts (median 12.4 vs 9.8 mo; HR, 0.73, 95% CI, 0.62-0.86;  P  < 0.0001). PFS was superior with pembro + chemo vs chemo in ESCC (median 6.3 vs 5.8 mo; HR 0.65; 95% CI, 0.54-0.78;  P \u00a0< 0.0001), CPS \u226510 (median 7.5 vs 5.5 mo; HR 0.51; 95% CI, 0.41-0.65;\u00a0 P  < 0.0001), and all pts (median 6.3 vs 5.8 mo; HR 0.65; 95% CI, 0.55-0.76;  P  < 0.0001). Confirmed ORR was 45.0% vs 29.3% ( P  < 0.0001) in all pts, with median DOR of 8.3 vs 6.0 mo. Grade 3-5 drug-related AE rates were 72% vs 68%. Discontinuation rates from drug-related AEs were 19% vs 12%. Conclusions Pembro + chemo provided superior OS, PFS, and ORR vs chemo, with a manageable safety profile in pts with untreated, advanced esophageal and EGJ cancer. These data demonstrate that 1L pembro + chemo is a new standard of care in this pt population. Clinical trial identification NCT03189719.

CheckMate 577 is the first global, randomized, double-blind, phase 3 study to report the efficacy and safety of a checkpoint inhibitor in the adjuvant setting after trimodality therapy for EC/GEJC. Methods Adults with resected (R0) stage II/III EC/GEJC who received neoadjuvant CRT and had residual pathologic disease were randomized 2:1 to nivolumab 240 mg or placebo Q2W for 16 weeks, followed by nivolumab 480 mg or placebo Q4W. Maximum treatment duration was 1 year. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS). Results 794 patients were randomized (nivolumab, 532; placebo, 262). Approximately 70% of patients had adenocarcinoma and almost 60% had a pathologic lymph node status \u2265ypN1 in both groups. At a pre-specified interim analysis, adjuvant nivolumab showed a statistically significant improvement in DFS vs placebo (HR 0.69 [96.4% CI 0.56 -0.86];\u00a0P\u00a0= 0.0003); median DFS was doubled (22.4 vs 11.0 mo, respectively;\u00a0Table). The majority of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were grade 1 or 2.

These results represent the first treatment advance in many years for these patients, potentially establishing adjuvant nivolumab as a new standard of care. Clinical trial identification NCT02743494.

However, changes have taken place in the management of stage IIIAN2 NSCLC pts including use of adjuvant chemotherapy (CT), patients\u2019 workup, quality of surgery and radiotherapy. Therefore the role of PORT warranted further investigations in high risk pts. Methods LungART is a multi-institutional randomized phase III trial comparing mediastinal PORT (54 Gy/27-30 fractions) to no PORT. Pts were eligible if they were PS 0-2, had a complete resection with nodal exploration, proven N2 disease; prior (neo)-adjuvant CT was allowed. The main end-point was disease-free survival (DFS). 500 pts and 292 events were required to show an improvement in DFS from 30% to 42% with PORT (bilateral test). Secondary endpoints included toxicity, local control, patterns of recurrence, overall survival (OS), second cancers, prognostic and predictive factors of treatment effect. Results Between August 2007 and July 2018, 501 patients were randomized after surgery or after CT: 252 pts allocated to PORT, and 249 to CA. Median age was 61 (range=36-85), 66% male, histology: mostly adenocarcinoma (73%) and work-up included PET scan in 91% pts. Most patients received CT (post op 77%, pre-op 18%). Analysis for DFS was performed with a median FU of 4.8 yrs; toxicity evaluated on 487 pts (246 in CA). Early and late Gr 3-5 cardio-pulmonary toxicity was respectively 7 and 20% in PORT vs 3,2 and 7,7 % in CA. DFS hazard ratio was 0.85 (95% CI 0.67; 1.07); p=0.16; median DFS was 30.5 months in PORT arm [24;48] and 22.8 in CA [17;37]; 3-year DFS was 47.1% with PORT vs 43.8% with no PORT. 3-year OS was 66.5% with PORT vs 68.5% with no PORT. Conclusions LungART is the first European randomized study evaluating modern PORT after complete resection, in pts selected predominantly with PET scan and having received (neo)adjuvant CT. 3-year DFS was higher than expected in both arms and PORT was associated with a non-statistically significant 15% increase in DFS among stage IIIAN2 pts.

PTEN loss (40%-50% of mCRPC) results in activation of AKT, the ipat target, and worse outcomes. Preclinically, dual pathway inhibition has greater antitumor activity than AR inhibition. IPATential150 is a phase III, randomised, double-blind study evaluating the efficacy and safety of adding ipat to abi in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic pts previously untreated for mCRPC. Methods Pts with mCRPC were randomised 1:1 to receive ipat (400 mg/d) + abi (1000 mg/d) + prednisone (5 mg bid) or pbo + abi + prednisone. Coprimary endpoints were investigator-assessed radiographic (r) PFS by PCWG3 criteria in pts with PTEN-loss tumours by immunohistochemistry (IHC; PTEN-loss in \u2265 50% of tumour cells) and in the overall ITT. Secondary endpoints included time to PSA progression, PSA response rate, confirmed ORR (per RECIST 1.1 + PCWG3) in ITT pts and pts with PTEN-loss tumours by IHC, and rPFS in pts with PTEN-loss tumours by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Results 1101 pts were randomised: 547 to ipat + abi and 554 to pbo + abi. Median follow-up was 19 mo. In PTEN loss by IHC pts, median rPFS was 18.5 mo (95% CI: 16.3, 22.1) with ipat and 16.5 mo (95% CI: 13.9, 17.0) with pbo (HR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.98; P = 0.0335); in ITT pts, rPFS was 19.2 mo (95% CI: 16.5, 22.3) with ipat and 16.6 mo (95% CI: 15.6, 19.1) with pbo (HR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.71, 0.99; P = 0.0431). Secondary endpoints favoured the combination arm (Table). Serious adverse events (AEs) occurred in 40% and 23% of ipat and pbo pts, respectively; AEs leading to discontinuation of ipat/pbo occurred in 21% and 5%. Conclusions In this primary endpoint analysis, ipat + abi as first-line treatment for mCRPC resulted in significantly improved rPFS and antitumor activity vs pbo + abi in pts with PTEN-loss mCRPC, but not in the ITT. The safety profile was in line with known and potential risks.

Final OS data are reported. Methods Men with mCRPC and disease progression on a prior new hormonal agent (eg enzalutamide or abiraterone) were randomized 2:1 to olaparib or control treatment. Pts could crossover to olaparib upon radiographic disease progression. A prespecified key secondary endpoint was OS in Cohort A, analysed by alpha-controlled stratified log-rank test. Results At data cut-off (20 March 2020), median final OS in Cohort A was significantly longer with olaparib than with physician\u2019s choice of enzalutamide or abiraterone (HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.50, 0.97;  P =0.0175), with a trend towards improvement in the overall population (HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.61, 1.03; nominal  P =0.0515). Of pts in the control arm, 56 (67%) in Cohort A and 86 (66%) in the overall population crossed over to olaparib. Longer follow-up yielded no new safety signals.

While many patients with HR+ disease will not recur or have distant relapse with standard therapies, up to 30% of patients whose cancer has high risk clinical and/or pathological features may experience distant relapse, many in the first 2 years. Novel treatment options are needed to prevent early recurrences and development of metastases for these patients. Abemaciclib is an oral, continuously dosed CDK4 & 6 inhibitor approved for use in HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer (ABC). Efficacy and safety of abemaciclib in ABC supported phase III evaluation in the adjuvant setting. Methods monarchE, an open-label, phase III study, included patients with HR+, HER2-, high risk EBC, who completed primary treatment. Patients with \u22654 positive nodes, or 1-3 nodes and at least one of the following: tumor size \u22655 cm, histologic grade 3, or central Ki-67 \u226520%, were eligible, and randomized (1:1) to abemaciclib (150 mg BID for 2 years) plus endocrine therapy (ET) or ET alone. A prespecified interim analysis was planned at \u223c293 IDFS events. The primary endpoint was invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) per STEEP criteria. Secondary endpoints included distant relapse-free survival (DRFS), overall survival, and safety. Results 5,637 patients were randomized. With 323 IDFS events observed in the intent-to-treat population, positive efficacy required a 2-sided p-value <0.0264. Abemaciclib plus ET demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in IDFS versus ET alone (p=.0096, HR: 0.747, 95% CI: 0.598, 0.932), corresponding to a 25.3% reduction in the risk of an IDFS event. The 2-year IDFS rates were 92.2% vs 88.7%, respectively. A similar improvement was observed for DRFS (HR: 0.717, 95% CI: 0.559, 0.920) with 2-year DRFS rates of 93.6% and 90.3%, respectively. Consistent benefit was seen in all prespecified subgroups. The most frequent AEs were diarrhea, neutropenia and fatigue in the abemaciclib arm and arthralgia, hot flush and fatigue in the control arm. Safety was consistent with the known profile of abemaciclib. Conclusions Abemaciclib when combined with ET is the first CDK4 & 6 inhibitor to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in IDFS in patients with HR+, HER2-, high risk EBC.

In the resected EGFRm NSCLC setting, the impact of treatment on sites of recurrence, including the CNS, is a key consideration. Osimertinib is a 3rd-generation EGFR-TKI with demonstrated efficacy in NSCLC CNS metastases. In ADAURA, osimertinib demonstrated a highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in disease-free survival vs placebo (PBO; DFS, hazard ratio [HR]: 0.20 [99.12% CI 0.14, 0.30; p<0.001) in resected stage IB\u2013IIIA EGFRm (ex19del/L858R) NSCLC (Ph III ADAURA; NCT02511106). We report an exploratory analysis of recurrence patterns. Methods Pts with resected stage IB\u2013IIIA EGFRm NSCLC, with/without adjuvant chemotherapy, were randomised 1:1 to receive osimertinib 80 mg once-daily or PBO until recurrence/discontinuation/3 years. Patterns of recurrence and CNS DFS (time to CNS recurrence/death) were exploratory endpoints. An MRI/CT brain scan was mandated at baseline either before surgery or upon enrolment, but was not required in absence of symptoms. Recurrence was categorised as local/regional and/or distant, with sites of relapse recorded. Data cutoff: 17/01/20. Results Overall, 682 pts were randomised (osimertinib: 339; PBO: 343). Pts treated with osimertinib had fewer recurrence events vs PBO (Table); 45 pts had CNS DFS events (osimertinib: 6; PBO: 39; median follow-up 22 months [mo]).

We report interim data from an open label randomized, multicenter, phase III study of lorlatinib vs crizotinib in pts with untreated  ALK + NSCLC (NCT03052608). Methods Untreated pts with  ALK + Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC (104 study sites; 23 countries) were randomized 1:1 to oral lorlatinib (100 mg QD) or crizotinib (250 mg BID); stratified by presence of CNS metastases and ethnicity. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review (BICR). PFS by investigator (INV), objective response (OR) and IC-OR by BICR, duration of response (DR), IC-DR, overall survival (OS) and safety were secondary endpoints. This planned interim analysis was conducted at 72% of 177 expected PFS events. Results Of 296 pts randomized, 291 received study treatment. At data cutoff (20 March 2020), median follow-up for PFS by BICR was 18.3 months (95% CI 16.4, 20.1) for lorlatinib (n=149) and 14.8 months (95% CI 12.8, 18.4) for crizotinib (n=147). PFS by BICR was significantly prolonged with lorlatinib vs crizotinib (HR 0.28; 95% CI 0.191, 0.413; stratified 1-sided p<0.001). Lorlatinib median PFS was NE (not estimable) (95% CI NE, NE) vs crizotinib 9.3 months (95% CI 7.6, 11.1). PFS by INV, OR and IC-OR by BICR were improved with lorlatinib vs crizotinib (Table). Grade 3\u20134 adverse events (AE)/AEs leading to treatment discontinuation: 72.5%/6.7% for lorlatinib; 55.6%/9.2% for crizotinib. The majority of Grade 3\u20134 AEs for lorlatinib were laboratory abnormalities, the most common of which were lipid abnormalities.

As monotherapies, N and C have demonstrated efficacy and a manageable safety profile in aRCC. C has immunomodulatory properties that may counteract tumor-induced immunosuppression, providing a rationale for combining N+C. Methods Patients (pts) were randomized 1:1 (stratified by IMDC risk score, tumor PD-L1 expression, region) to N 240 mg flat dose IV Q2W + C 40 mg PO QD v S 50 mg PO for 4 wk (6-wk cycles) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (max N treatment, 2 y). Primary endpoint: progression-free survival (PFS; a \u00bc 0.05 final) by blinded independent central review (BICR). Secondary endpoints (hierarchical testing): overall survival (OS; a \u00bc 0.011 first interim analysis), objective response rate (ORR; a \u00bc 0.05 final) by BICR, and safety. Results A total of 651 pts (22.6% favorable risk, 57.6% intermediate risk, 19.7% poor risk; 24.9% PD-L1 _1%) were randomized to N+C (n \u00bc 323) v S (n \u00bc 328). With 18.1 mo median (10.6 mo minimum) study follow-up, all 3 efficacy endpoints were met. N+C significantly improved PFS (HR 0.51 [95% CI 0.41e0.64], P < 0.0001; median, 16.6 v 8.3 mo) and OS (HR 0.60 [98.89% CI 0.40e0.89]; P \u00bc 0.0010; medians not reached) v S, and results were consistent across prespecified IMDC risk and PD-L1 subgroups. ORR (95% CI) was significantly higher with N+C v S (55.7% [50.1e61.2] v 27.1% [22.4e32.3]; P < 0.0001), and 8.0% v 4.6% of pts achieved complete response. Median duration of response was 20.2 v 11.5 mo for N+C v S. Any-grade TRAEs occurred in 96.6% v 93.1% of pts treated with N+C v S (60.6% v 50.9% grade _3). One treatment-related death occurred with N+C v 2 with S. TRAEs led to discontinuation of S in 8.8%, N or C in 15.3%, N+C in 3.1%, N only in 5.6%, and C only in 6.6% of pts. Conclusions N+C demonstrated superior PFS, OS, and ORR v S in 1L aRCC. The safety profile of this combination was manageable and consistent with the known singleagent AE profiles of N and C. These results support N+C as a new CPI+TKI option for aRCC pts. Clinical trial identification NCT03141177.

Blocking tumour-associated VEGF may promote T-cell infiltration into the tumour bed and boost anti-tumour immune response, justifying combination with bev. Dual VEGF-A and PD-L1 blockade is effective in lung and hepatocellular cancers. Methods IMagyn050 (NCT03038100) enrolled patients (pts) with newly diagnosed untreated stage III/IV OC who underwent either primary cytoreductive surgery (PCS) with gross residual disease or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and interval surgery. Eligible pts were randomised 1:1 to atezo 1200 mg or pbo cycles 1\u201322, with paclitaxel 175 mg/m 2  + carboplatin AUC6 cycles 1\u20136 + bev 15 mg/kg cycles 2\u201322 (PCS pts), omitting peri-operative bev in NACT pts. Cycles were repeated q3w. Stratification factors were: stage (III vs IV), ECOG PS (0 vs 1/2), PD-L1 staining in immune cells (IC <1% vs \u22651% [PD-L1+]) and treatment strategy (PCS vs NACT). The co-primary endpoints were investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS; RECIST v1.1) and overall survival (OS) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) and PD-L1+ populations. PFS was tested in parallel in the two populations; OS was tested hierarchically. Results Of 1301 enrolled pts, \u223c25% received NACT. At the data cut-off (30 Mar 2020) median follow-up was \u223c20 months in both arms. There was no statistically significant PFS improvement in either the ITT population (HR 0.92 [95% CI 0.79\u20131.07]; median 18.4 months with pbo vs 19.5 months with atezo) or the PD-L1+ population (HR 0.80 [0.65\u20130.99], median 18.5 vs 20.8 months, respectively). Exploratory PFS analyses in the PD-L1 IC \u22655% subgroup showed a trend favouring atezo. Though immature, first interim OS results did not show significant benefit from atezo. Similar proportions discontinued any study treatment for AEs (22% pbo vs 26% atezo pts). The safety profile of atezo + bev + chemotherapy was consistent with expected AEs. Conclusions Atezo did not significantly improve PFS in the ITT or PD-L1+ population. The combination was generally well tolerated with manageable AEs.

ICON8 had co-primary outcomes of progression free (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Mature OS and updated PFS results are reported here. Methods Eligible women with FIGO stage IcG3-IV EOC were randomised 1:1:1 to arm 1 standard chemotherapy (q3w carboplatin AUC5/6 + q3w paclitaxel 175mg/m 2 ); arm 2 weekly paclitaxel (q3w carboplatin AUC5/6 + q1w paclitaxel 80mg/m 2 ); arm 3 weekly carboplatin-paclitaxel (q1w carboplatin AUC2 + q1w paclitaxel 80mg/m 2 ). Patients received immediate primary surgery (IPS) prior to entering ICON8 or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with planned delayed primary surgery (DPS) during chemotherapy. Analyses are performed on an intention to treat basis, comparing arms 2v1 and 3v1. Results From Jun 2011 - Nov 2014, 1566 patients were randomised, 522, 523, 521 in arms 1, 2, 3 respectively. Baseline characteristics were well-balanced \u2013 median age 62 years; serous histology 72%; stage Ic-II 19%, IIIa-IIIb 10%, IIIc-IV 72%. 48% patients had IPS, 50% planned DPS and 2% inoperable. At 1 st  Oct 2019, 923 deaths had been reported, arm 1 319 (61%); arm 2 300 (57%); arm 3 304 (58%). No significant improvement in OS was observed in either comparison: arm 2v1 log rank p=0.14, hazard ratio (HR) = 0.88 (97.5% confidence interval (CI) 0.74, 1.06); arm 3v1 log rank p=0.27, HR = 0.91 (97.5% CI 0.76, 1.09). Median OS was 47.4, 54.1 and 53.4 months in arms 1, 2, 3 respectively. No heterogeneity in treatment effect was noted on subgroup analysis by surgical approach (IPS vs DPS). Updated PFS was also analysed. As in the primary analysis, no significant difference in PFS was observed with either weekly treatment (log-rank arm 2v1 p=0.37, arm 3v1 p=0.48; restricted mean PFS time 25, 25.5, 25.9 months in arms 1, 2, 3 respectively). Conclusions The final analysis for ICON8 confirms that, although weekly dose-dense chemotherapy is a safe alternative to q3w chemotherapy and can be delivered successfully in first-line EOC treatment, it does not significantly improve PFS or OS.

The phase 2 study innovaTV 204 was conducted to assess the potential of tisotumab vedotin, a tissue factor\u2013directed antibody\u2013drug conjugate, to address this high unmet need in patients with r/mCC. Methods Patients with r/mCC with disease progression on or after doublet chemotherapy with bevacizumab (if eligible by local standards) and \u22642 prior systemic regimens received tisotumab vedotin 2.0 mg/kg IV once every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was confirmed objective response rate (cORR) as assessed by independent review committee (IRC). Secondary endpoints included duration of response (DOR), time to response (TTR), and progression-free survival (PFS) by IRC, overall survival (OS), and safety. Results Of 101 patients treated (median 6 doses), median age was 50 years, 68% had squamous histology, and 63% received bevacizumab plus doublet chemotherapy as first-line treatment. cORR (IRC) was 24%, including 7% with complete response (CR) (Table). Disease control rate (DCR) was 72%. At a median follow-up of 10 months the median DOR was 8.3 months, median PFS was 4.2 months, and median OS was 12.1 months. Response rates were generally consistent across subgroups explored. The most common treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were alopecia (38%), epistaxis (30%), and nausea (27%). Grade 3 ocular, bleeding, and peripheral neuropathy TRAEs (prespecified adverse events of interest) occurred in 2%, 2%, and 7% of patients, respectively.

A phase II trial has supported the efficacy of nivolumab in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, but a randomized trial is required to confirm its efficacy. This multicenter, open-label, randomized, phase III study investigated the efficacy and safety of nivolumab vs gemcitabine or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (GEM/PLD) in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Methods Patients aged \u226520 years with platinum-resistant (advanced or recurrent) ovarian cancer and no prior GEM/PLD treatment were randomized (1:1) to nivolumab (240 mg intravenously [IV], every 2 weeks) or GEM/PLD (GEM 1000 mg/m 2  IV for 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15, then every 4 weeks; or PLD 50 mg/m 2  IV every 4 weeks) after stratifying for histological type (clear cell carcinoma vs others) and number of prior chemotherapy regimens after diagnosis of resistance (0 or 1). Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Tumor was assessed every 8 weeks through week 48, then every 12 weeks. Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and safety. Results Of 316 patients randomized, 77.8% had \u22652 prior chemotherapies and 14.2% had ECOG PS score of 1. Median OS was 10.12 (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.34-14.09) months with nivolumab (n=157) and 12.09 (95% CI, 9.26-15.34) months with GEM/PLD (n=159), with no statistically significant difference between the groups (hazard ratio [HR] 1.03, 95% CI, 0.80-1.32;  P= 0.808). Median PFS was 2.04 (95% CI, 1.91-2.20) months with nivolumab and 3.84 (95% CI, 3.58-4.17) months with GEM/PLD (HR 1.46; 95% CI, 1.15-1.85;  P= 0.002). The rate of treatment-related grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) was 22.4% with nivolumab and 68.4% with GEM/PLD; the major AEs (all grades) with nivolumab were diarrhea (15.4%), nausea, pruritus and rash (12.2% each). There was no difference in the toxicity profile of nivolumab from that previously reported. Conclusions Nivolumab did not improve OS compared with GEM/PLD in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Clinical trial identification JapicCTI-153004.

A translational research program including gene expression signatures was launched to identify biomarkers for outcome to N. Methods Among the 324 pts included in the NIVOREN translational cohort, RNA-sequencing was performed on 79 FFPE primary ccRCCs. We first evaluated the impact of Teff and Angio signatures on the outcome, based on median mRNA expression values, as described in the IMmotion 150 RCC trial. To better characterize the tumor microenvironment, we performed an unsupervised analysis using MCP-Counter to classify tumors according to their infiltration by 8 immune (I) and 2 stromal (S) (fibroblasts and endothelial) cell populations. Outcomes were the response rate (RR, best response determined by complete or partial response) and PFS. Results Angio\u2013 and Teff signatures were not predictive of outcomes on N when applied separately. However, combination of these two signatures revealed that the most aggressive tumors Teff-high/Angio-low and Teff-low/Angio-low were significantly associated with RR and PFS (Table).Unsupervised classification identified 5 KIC subtypes (A to E). CD8-high/S-low (KIC C+E) tumors were associated with higher RR and longer PFS compared to I-low/S-low (KIC A), I-low/S-high (KIC B) and I-high/S-high (KIC D) tumors (Table). Principal component analysis showed a similar contribution of KIC stromal cells and the Angio signatures in worst outcome tumors. The KIC classification identified tumor microenvironments linked to good outcomes on N and unraveled the deleterious clinical impact of the potential immunosuppression exerted by neutrophils, fibroblasts and endothelial cells.

Previous work in mRCC has shown that ctDNA profiles evolve with treatment in mRCC. We utilized a commercially available ctDNA assay to identify common GAs in mRCC and compared ctDNA and tissue-based GAs in pts with mRCC. Methods We retrospectively identified consecutive pts with mRCC who underwent ctDNA testing using a clinically-validated 73- to 74-gene panel (Guardant360) between November 2016\u2013December 2019. The targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) ctDNA assay included analysis of sequence alterations, small insertions/deletions, amplifications, and fusions. In a subset of pts, GAs identified with ctDNA were compared to GAs detected via tissue-based platforms with using either whole-exome sequencing (Ashion Analytics) or targeted NGS (Foundation Medicine). Tissue test results included variants of unknown significance (VUS), as some clinically relevant alterations were classified as such. Results Across 847 mRCC pts (600 male, 247 female), \u22651 GAs were detected in 669/929 (72%) ctDNA samples. After excluding VUS and synonymous variants, TP53 (37%), VHL (22%), and EGFR (6%) were the most frequently altered genes in ctDNA. Tissue DNA analysis of 47 pts was also assessed; VHL (63.8%), PBRM1 (44.7%) and SETD2 (31.9%) were most frequently mutated (the latter two genes were not included on the ctDNA assay). Median time between tissue and ctDNA assays was 15.3 months (IQR, 7.5-29.8). When restricted to only the genes included on the ctDNA assay, a total of 154 GAs were found across both assays. Of these, 41 (26.6%) GAs were exclusive to blood, 92 (59.7%) were exclusive to tissue, and 21 (13.6%) were found on both platforms. The cumulative concordance rate between ctDNA and tissue DNA samples was 96.6%. Sequential ctDNA assessment was available in 65 pts; results will be presented at the meeting. Conclusions With the largest mRCC cohort to date, our study shows ctDNA analysis is feasible and highly concordant with tissue genomic analysis. Exclusive GAs found on both platforms suggests tumor evolution over time and treatment, which may assist in guiding treatment selection in mRCC. Legal entity responsible for the study The authors.

COSMIC-021, a multicenter phase 1b study, is evaluating the combination of C + A in various solid tumors (NCT03170960). We present initial results in first-line ccRCC. Methods Patients (pts) with ccRCC were enrolled in the dose escalation (N=10) and expansion stage (N=60). Pts were enrolled sequentially to receive A 1200 mg IV Q3W with either C 40 mg (dose level 40 [DL 40 ], N=34) or C 60 mg (DL 60,  N=36) PO QD in each stage. Eligible pts had ECOG PS 0-1. None had received prior systemic anticancer therapy for advanced RCC. The primary endpoint is ORR per RECIST v1.1 by investigator. Other endpoints include safety, PFS, and OS. Results As of Mar 27, 2020, 70 pts with ccRCC (34 at DL 40  and 36 at DL 60 ) had a median follow-up of 22.0 mo (range 17, 29) for DL 40  and 11.5 (6, 28) for DL 60 . Baseline characteristics were similar in the two dose groups. Median age for all pts was 65 y, 76% were male, 74% had ECOG PS 0, 87% had prior nephrectomy, 77% had lung metastases, and 46% had \u22653 sites of disease. 30% were favorable, 67% were intermediate, and 3% were poor risk by IMDC criteria. Grade 3/4 TRAEs occurred in 71% of DL 40  and 64% of DL 60  pts, with no grade 5 TRAEs at either dose. The most common grade 3/4 TRAEs in all pts were hypertension (21% in DL 40  and 14% in DL 60 ), diarrhea (9% and 19%), hypophosphatemia (15% and 3%), and ALT increased (3% and 14%). For DL 40 , ORR was 47% (1 CR and 15 PRs), DCR (CR+PR+SD) was 94%, median PFS was 19.5 mo, and 12 mo PFS rate was 67%. For DL 60 , ORR was 58% (2 CRs and 19 PRs), DCR was 92%, median PFS was 20.4 mo, and 12 mo PFS rate was 71%. Available tumor tissue (n=40) was evaluated for PD-L1 expression, and no association with antitumor activity was shown. Increased median levels of activated peripheral cytotoxic T (+8%) and NK (+24%) cells were observed at day 21 with a concomitant decrease in immunosuppressive cells. Conclusions C + A demonstrated encouraging clinical activity in previously untreated pts with advanced ccRCC with an acceptable safety profile at both C doses evaluated. A phase 3 study of C + A in RCC previously treated with ICI therapy is planned. Clinical trial identification NCT03170960. Editorial acknowledgement Julie Lougheed, Exelixis.

Based on unsupervised analysis of genes expressed in m-ccRCC, we identified 4 groups (ccrcc1-4) with immune and angiogenic high/low features which could allow to better identify responders to either N, NI or TKI. We here report final analysis results of the BIONIKK trial. Methods BIONIKK is an open-label, French multicenter randomized phase 2 trial evaluating N vs. NI vs. TKI in upfront m-ccRCC according to ccrcc1-4 (35-gene signature, CITsig). ccrcc1,4 and ccrcc2,3 pts were randomized to receive N vs. NI and NI vs. TKI respectively. Primary endpoint (PE): objective response rate (ORR, RECIST1.1) per treatment and group. Secondary endpoints: progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and tolerability. 150 pts were expected in target cohort (TC). An additional cohort was included to assess inter-platform variability. Results From 06/2017 to 07/2019: screened=308, randomized=202 (ALL), evaluable for PE=187 with TC=154. No correlation between ccrcc1-4 and IMDC risk groups (p=0.14). ORR (TC): N=30%, NI=44%, TKI=50%, with differences according to ccrcc1-4 (table1). ORR for NI were comparable across all groups. In ccrcc1 ORR for N was half that of NI while both were comparable in ccrcc4. In ccrcc2, ORR for TKI was as high as for NI. After a median (m) FU of 16 months (mo), mPFS (TC, mo): N=4.9, NI=10.4, TKI=NR, with again observed differences according to ccrcc1-4. OS data are not mature (events:16%). No new safety signal emerged compared to published data. CITsig in frozen and FFPE samples will be presented at the meeting.

Amongst the different types of CRCs, the hypermethylated subtype (CIMP) is the most aggressive. In a previous study, we identified that CIMP CRCs are able to form a new metastatic intermediate consisting of clusters of a hundred cells found in the peritoneal cavity of metastatic patients. Furthermore, these collective structures can also be found in the primary tumour. Importantly, when invading they only exist as collectives and do not show any sign of adhesion with the extracellular matrix or cell protrusion which are characteristics of collective mesenchymal migration, the only mode of collective dissemination described to date. These data suggest that CIMP clusters are using a new mode of invasion resembling the amoeboid movement of single cells, never described before. Methods We used microfluidics coated with non-adhesive polymer. Results We find that CIMP and colorectal cell line clusters confined in non-adhesive microchannels are able to move, independently of the formation of focal adhesions or protruding leader cells. Their migration speed ranged between 70 to 150\u03bcm/day, in line with observed cancer spread in vivo. We show that clusters display a supra-cellular actin cortex with increased contractility towards the rear of moving clusters, indicated by Myosin-II accumulation. This is a typical feature of amoeboid motion, where Rho activity is more intense towards the back. Indeed, interfering with ROCK or myosin activation strongly opposed migration. Moreover, using optogenetic tools we show that Rho activation at the back of the cluster is sufficient to promote migration. Conclusions By studying primary cancer specimens and cell lines from colorectal cancer, we demonstrate the existence of a second mode of collective migration, presenting the hallmarks of amoeboid migration, that we named collective amoeboid. This mode could be use by other cancer clusters when confronted to non-adhesive interfaces like the lumen of lymphatic vessels. This work suggests that therapies targeting adhesive properties of cancer cells might be unsuccessful and unravels a new therapeutic avenue to limit the metastatic spread of CRCs.

The identification of decisive drivers of metastasis is thus an urgent therapeutic need. Methods Cancer cell spheroids, wound healing and cell aggregation assays were utilized to explore cell-cell adhesion capacity. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy and flow cytometry analysis were utilized to quantify expression of target proteins, IHC analysis quantified the expression of target molecules in primary tumors and metastases. Pre-clinical models of orthotopic growth of colon cancer and metastatic diffusion to the liver were utilized. Xenotransplant transcriptome analysis assessed EMT determinant transcription. Patients: 24 distinct case series of breast, colon, uterus, ovary, stomach, lung, and pancreatic cancers, for a total number of 13,042 primary tumors were analyzed. Kaplan\u2013Meier plots were used to illustrate survival and metastatic relapse in investigated cohorts. Results We identify functional inactivation of highly expressed E-cadherin as a pivotal driver of metastatic diffusion in human cancer. E-cadherin is inactivated by binding to Trop-2, which causes release from the cytoskeleton, loss of cell-cell adhesion and activation of \u03b2-catenin, while maintaining epithelial differentiation. This leads to anti-apoptotic signaling, increased cell migration capacity and enhanced cancer cell survival. This global, Trop-2/E-cadherin/\u03b2-catenin-driven pro-metastatic program was recapitulated in human cancer, and was shown to profoundly impact on breast, colon, ovary, uterus, stomach cancer metastatic diffusion. Conclusions We identify functional inactivation of E-cadherin by Trop-2 as a pivotal driver of EMT-less metastatic diffusion in human cancer. This global, Trop-2/E-cadherin/b-catenin\u2013driven pro-metastatic program profoundly impacts on the survival of patients bearing breast, colon, uterus, ovary, stomach, lung, pancreas tumours, paving the way for novel diagnostic procedures and anti-cancer therapies.

It\u2019s well established chemotherapies, most often used to treat cancers are associated with adverse effects such as weight loss, emesis/nausea, leading to limited tolerability and effectiveness of treatment. GDF-15 is a cytokine reported to cause anorexia, aversion/emesis and weight loss in preclinical models and is associated with cancer cachexia and poor survival in patients. GDF-15 inhibition was effective to reverse weight loss, muscle and fat loss in mouse tumor models. Interestingly, it remains unclear whether increased skeletal muscle mass by GDF-15 inhibition results in restoration of muscle function. GDF-15 is also associated with platinum-based chemotherapy-induced adverse effects, however, a causal role for GDF-15 in mediating the emetic response has not been established. Methods We investigated these questions in a mouse tumor model, TOV21G and non-human primates (NHP) using a potent and selective monoclonal antibody (mAB1) that neutralizes circulating GDF-15. Results Treatment with mAb1 completely reversed tumor-induced cachexia including weight loss, lean and fat mass loss as well as declined muscle function and physical performance in tumor bearing mice. We show that cisplatin-induced weight loss and anorexia is GDF-15 dependent in mouse. In addition, Cisplatin induced GDF-15 circulating level and emesis in NHP and mAB1 treatment markedly attenuated cisplatin-induced emesis. Importantly, the preclinical findings are supported by patient data where we demonstrate an association between elevated circulating GDF-15 levels and platinum-based chemotherapy use. Conclusions Our findings indicate GDF-15 is a key regulator of cancer cachexia and chemotherapy-induced malaise. GDF-15 inhibition holds the potential as an effective therapeutic approach in combination with chemotherapy to alleviate GDF-15 mediated malaise, declined physical function and cachexia in patients.

The crosstalk between the Cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) and PI3K pathways represents a strong rationale for co-targeting both axes to inhibit tumor growth. Moreover, combined treatment with PI3K and CDK4/6 inhibitors has been shown to overcome CDK4/6 inhibitor resistance in BC cells. We investigated the triple combination of ER, CDK4/6, and PI3K pathway inhibitors in  ex vivo  BC models as a novel strategy to overcome endocrine and CDK4/6-resistance. Methods We generated 25  ex vivo  three dimensional spheroid culture models (organoids) from ER-positive BC samples, obtained from patients at surgery. After 5 days of treatment, we investigated anti-proliferative effects by MTT assay in these models with single agents, dual and triple combinations of Fulvestrant (F), Palbociclib (P) and Taselisib (T) as models of ET, CDK 4/6 and PI3K pathway inhibitors, respectively. We are also performing NGS analysis of both organoids and surgical samples to investigate predictive genomic biomarkers. Results Our results demonstrated that combination of F, P and T had a synergistic effect on the inhibition of spheroids proliferation in \u224830% of the examined samples compared to single drug treatments. Two subgroups of samples with different behavior were identified: one group showed no effect after single or triple treatment with only \u224815% reduction in cell viability (probably resistant) while the other group exhibited greater sensitivity to treatments (e.g. lobular histotype). Ongoing NGS analysis including a full panel of cancer-related genes, such as genes involved in CDK and PI3K pathways resistance. We will analyze concordance between surgical samples and  ex vivo  models in terms of genomic features and we will explore predictive role of genomic alterations. Conclusions The results showed an encouraging activity of the triple combination of ER, CDK4/6, and PI3K pathway inhibitors in ex vivo models of ER-positive BC. The different effect of the treatments could suggest a correlation between mutation setting and individual response. Legal entity responsible for the study University of Campania. Funding Pfizer.

Pts randomized to pembro who completed 2 years of therapy or who stopped pembro after achieving CR and then had PD were eligible for a second course of pembro monotherapy. Endpoints included PFS (primary); OS, ORR, and safety (secondary); and duration of response (exploratory). For this analysis, response/PD was assessed by investigators per RECIST v1.1. Results 305 pts were randomized (pembro, 154; chemo, 151). As of June 1, 2020, median (range) time from randomization to data cutoff was 59.9 (55.1\u201368.4) mo. 83 (55.0%) pts randomized to chemo crossed over to pembro. Efficacy in the ITT population and in 39/154 (25.3%) pts in the pembro arm who completed 35 cycles of pembro are shown in the Table. 12/154 pts started second course pembro; outcomes in these pts will be presented. Among all treated pts, incidence of treatment-related grade 3\u20135 AEs was 31.2% with pembro vs 53.3% with chemo.

Methods Pts were randomised 1:1 to receive cemiplimab 350 mg Q3W IV or investigator\u2019s choice of chemo. Crossover (CO) from chemo to cemiplimab was allowed following progression. The primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) per blinded Independent Review Committee. A prespecified interim analysis was performed after 50% of OS events. Data are presented per intention-to-treat (ITT) and in a PD-L1 \u226550% ITT population which comprised only pts with PD-L1 \u226550% by 22C3 per instruction for use (after recommended retesting in some pts). Data cut-off was 1 March 2020. Results In the ITT population (median follow-up: 13.1 months), median OS was 22.1 months (95% CI: 17.7\u2013not evaluable [NE]) with cemiplimab (n=356) vs 14.3 months (95% CI: 11.7\u201319.2) with chemo (n=354; HR, 0.68; 95% CI: 0.53\u20130.87; P=0.002). Median PFS was 6.2 months (95% CI: 4.5\u20138.3) with cemiplimab vs 5.6 months (95% CI: 4.5\u20136.1) with chemo (HR, 0.59; 95% CI: 0.49\u20130.72; P<0.0001). In the PD-L1 \u226550% ITT population (median follow-up: 10.8 months), median OS was not reached (95% CI: 17.9\u2013NE) with cemiplimab (n=283) vs 14.2 months (95% CI: 11.2\u201317.5) with chemo (n=280; HR, 0.57; 95% CI: 0.42\u20130.77; P=0.0002). Median PFS was 8.2 months (95% CI: 6.1\u20138.8) with cemiplimab vs 5.7 months (95% CI: 4.5\u20136.2) with chemo (HR, 0.54; 95% CI: 0.43\u20130.68; P<0.0001). CO rate to cemiplimab was 73.9%. In the ITT population, cemiplimab was associated with higher response rate (36.5% vs 20.6%), longer median duration of response (21.0 months vs 6.0 months) and lower rates of Grade \u22653 adverse events regardless of attribution (37.2% vs 48.5%) compared to chemo. Conclusions In this study, 1L cemiplimab monotherapy significantly improved OS and PFS vs chemo in pts with advanced NSCLC with PD-L1 \u226550%, despite high CO rate, providing rationale for cemiplimab as a new treatment option for this patient population.

These ICIs significantly improve long-term outcome in 20% of advanced NSCLC pts but to date, no robust biomarker predicts primary or secondary resistance. Methods Advanced NSCLC pts with available archived tumor tissue treated with either nivolumab, pembrolizumab or atezolizumab, alone (2 nd  line min) or combined with chemotherapy (1 st  line), were systematically re-biopsied and blood-sampled at 6wks (V2) of treatment. ORR was assessed by RECIST 1.1 every 6wks. Quantification of circulating and tumor infiltrating immune cells and PD-L1 mediated inhibition (Immunoscore\u00ae IC) were performed by FACS and multiplex IHC coupled to digital pathology respectively. Endothelial activation, blood soluble factors, PK and TMB through WES were also assessed. Results The first 100 pts are mainly male (64%), smokers (91-8%), <65yrs (55%), with an ECOG PS0/1 (97%), treated in 2 nd  line setting (86%). Tumors were mainly ADC (57%) with \u22651% PDL1 expression in 38% of the cases. 21% were still on treatment at data cut-off. V2 biopsy was available in 46% of cases; 33 pts progressed before the 6wks milestone, and 13 pts were considered as responders. Median PFS was 2.99 months (mo) [95%CI: 2.43 \u2013 4.83] and median OS was 11.01 mo [95%CI: 8.21 - NA]. At baseline (VS), PD-L1 tumor cell percentage was significantly higher in responders, as well as tumor infiltration by cytotoxic lymphocytes (cTILs) (median: 160 vs 410 cells/mm 2 ). Five non-responders presented high cTILs densities (up to 1800 cells/mm 2 ), associated either to no PDL1 expression, high infiltration of Treg cells in the tumor or weak PD1 expression on cTILs. High immune cell densities at the periphery and in the tumor were associated with survival. Immune cell infiltration and PD-L1+ cell density increased from VS to V2, as well as proximity between these cells. Massive PK variability among patients was found. Conclusions Immune cells quantification and characterization add value to clinical factors to predict advanced NSCLC response/resistance to ICIs.

It is becoming evident that cytotoxic chemotherapy and angiogenesis inhibitors may enhance therapeutic benefits of immune checkpoint inhibitors such as nivolumab. ONO-4538-52/TASUKI-52 is the first randomized, double-blinded phase III trial of nivolumab plus platinum chemotherapy with bevacizumab for first-line treatment of non-squamous NSCLC. Methods Between May 2017 and June 2019, treatment-na\u00efve stage IIIB/IV or recurrent nsq NSCLC patients without sensitizing EGFR or ALK alterations were randomized 1:1 to receive nivolumab (360 mg) or placebo in combination with carboplatin (AUC 6), paclitaxel (200 mg/m 2 ), and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) every 3 weeks for up to 6 cycles. Subsequently, the treatments with nivolumab/placebo and bevacizumab were maintained until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by the independent radiology review committee (IRRC). Results Of 550 patients in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, and 273 (nivolumab) and 275 (placebo) received \u2265 1 dose of the study drugs. At the interim analysis on July 2020 where the median follow-up was 13.7 months, PFS was significantly longer in the nivolumab arm compared to the placebo arm with the median PFS of 12.12 vs 8.11 months (hazard ratio [HR], 0.56; 96.37% CI, 0.43-0.71; p<0.0001) and 12-month PFS rate of 50.1% vs 30.2%. IRRC assessed Objective response rates were 61.5% and 50.5% in the nivolumab and placebo arms, respectively. OS, while not mature, tended to be longer in the nivolumab arm compared to the placebo arm (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.63-1.14). Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) with grade 3 or 4 and TRAEs leading to treatment discontinuation were observed in 73.6% and 16.5% in the nivolumab arm and 72.0% and 4.4% in the placebo arm, respectively. Most frequently-observed TRAEs were alopecia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, and decreased neutrophil count. Conclusions ONO-4538-52/TASUKI-52 met the primary endpoint; nivolumab in combination with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab significantly prolonged PFS with a manageable safety profile.

In the first-line treatment for patients with high PD-L1 expression, pembrolizumab or Atez each has been shown to prolong overall survival compared with platinum doublet therapy. On the other hand, Bev enhances the efficacy of cytotoxic agents and EGFR-TKI in non-Sq NSCLC. In addition, preclinical models have shown that Bev also enhances the antitumor activity of PD-1/-PD-L1 antibodies. Methods We conducted a single-arm phase II study to investigate clinical benefits of adding Bev 15 mg/kg to Atez 1200 mg/body in the 1st line setting for patients with high PD-L1 expression. Both agents were administered on day 1 q3wk until disease progression. Patients were eligible if they had pathologically confirmed advanced non-Sq NSCLC without any EGFR/ALK/ROS1 alterations, had ECOG performance status 0-1, and PD-L1 expression\u226550% detected by Dako 22C3 antibody. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) assessed by the central review committee (CRC). The sample size was set as 38 assuming that the threshold of ORR was 40% and the expected ORR was 62%. Secondary endpoints were progression free survival (PFS), duration of response, overall survival, and safety. Results From August 2018 to January 2020, 40 patients were enrolled from 14 institutions. Of the 40 patients, 33 (83%) were male with a median age of 68 (range: 41-75), 36 (90%) had a history of smoking. One patient was ineligible and did not receive protocol treatment. As of 31 March 2020, none and 25 of the 39 patients were judged as CR and PR, indicating that ORR was 64.1% (95%CI: 47.2-78.8). One year PFS rate was 54.9%. The median number of treatment cycles was 12 (1-27). The treatment was discontinued in 19 patients, 17 and 2 of whose reasons were disease progression and immune-related adverse events, such as sclerosing cholangitis and encephalopathy, respectively. The number of serious adverse events was 23 in 12 patients, but no grade 4/5 toxicity was observed. Conclusions This positive result supports Atez with Bev as a potential treatment option for non-Sq NSCLC with high PD-L1 expression. Legal entity responsible for the study West Japan Oncology Group.

Nevertheless, observed cancer incidence and mortality suffer from an inherent registration delay in the data production workflow. To overcome this, the European Commission\u2019s Joint Research Centre in collaboration with the WHO\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer have computed estimates of cancer incidence and mortality, for the year 2020 and for European countries, in the framework of the European Cancer Information System (ECIS). Methods Predicted values for the year 2020 are based on the incidence data of more than 150 European population-based cancer registries included in ECIS, and on mortality data provided by WHO. Ad-hoc statistical models were developed on the basis of the most recent time trends of observed data to estimate cancer incidence and mortality rates in each EU country for the year 2020. Estimated rates were then applied to the projected population figures for 2020 from EUROSTAT in order to calculate the predicted number of new cases and deaths for 2020 in 40 European countries. Results The number of new cancer cases and deaths in 2020 has been estimated per country by sex and age group, for 25 major cancer sites. The results are included and disseminated through the European Cancer Information System (ECIS) web application. Conclusions The release of up-to-date cancer incidence and mortality estimates is of great importance to support EU evidence-based cancer policies. The homogeneity of the estimation methods applied throughout Europe guarantees the comparability of the estimated values between countries. Reliable and comparable estimates highlight differences between countries in cancer incidence and mortality, thus facilitating the identification of possible intervention areas. The applied methodology couldn\u2019t take into account the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the projected rates. A future exercise to evaluate the discrepancy between projected and observed rates will allow quantification of this impact. Legal entity responsible for the study The authors.

Yet, there is limited data on their distribution and access in Europe. To ascertain the extent of potential inequalities in access to clinical trials in Europe, we compared their distribution among European countries. Methods The Clinicaltrials.gov database was searched for interventional clinical trials in adults with neoplasms. Available data from phase I-III trials between 06/2009 to 06/2019 in Europe were retrieved. We considered the number of clinical trials registered in each country and one \u201ctrial-entry\u201d was defined as one trial/country. Results In total, 18454 trial-entries were identified, of which 12% were phase I, 10% phase I/II, 32% phase II, 2% phase II/III and 44% phase III; 74% were industry-sponsored, 15% were academic and 11% were an academic/industry partnership. The number of trials per country varied from 2.48 in Central/Eastern Europe to 5.33/100 000 inhabitants in Northern Europe. The proportion of phase I-II trials was higher in the Southern and Western regions (13-15%) compared to Central/Eastern and Northern regions (4-9%). The number of trial-entries/100 000 inhabitants/country ranged from 0.14 (Albania) to 10.7 (Belgium). Between 2010 and 2018, the total number of trials per country in Europe increased by 33%. The increase in early-phase trials was larger (phase I-II, 61%) than in late-phase trials (phase II-III, 7%). Portugal, Ireland, Finland, Greece and Norway registered the largest percentage increase in early-phase trials, while Ireland, Spain, Norway, Italy and Belgium led the largest percentage increase in late-phase trials. Five countries dominated in terms of an increase in the absolute number of total trial-entries in both early- and late-phase trials: Spain (90/40), France (45/16), UK (45/13), Italy (38/19) and Belgium (35/12). During this period there was no significant variation in the distribution of industry and academic sponsored trials but an increase in industry/academic partnerships was observed ( \u2248  8%). Conclusions The number of clinical trials varies greatly among European regions resulting in potential asymmetries in patients' access to clinical trials. The disparities in access to oncology trials need to be addressed by all the stakeholders. Legal entity responsible for the study The authors. Funding Has not received any funding. Disclosure T.M.S.

A recognized barrier to implementation has been the uncertainty of basing policy or financial decisions on clinical trial results that may inadequately predict a product\u2019s performance in real-world settings or populations. To inform such models and policy decisions, stakeholders would ideally be able to forecast financial impact prior to implementation. Doing so also protects potential down-side financial risk\u2014a key consideration in health systems reliant on public funds with responsibility for prudent budget management. We therefore sought to develop a methodology for forecasting a range of reasonably expected real-world clinical outcomes (RWCOs) using published data from recent oncology clinical trials and post-market studies. Methods Using a database of 40 follow-on, longitudinal outcomes studies from 2008-2019 in a large US community oncology network, we identified and matched phase 3 trials and cohorts to real-world studies to compile a dataset. To approach forecasting a range of reasonably expected RWCOs for the identified clinical trials in this dataset, we used nonlinear regression analysis and Monte Carlo simulation to fit and stress-test a curve across the matched cohorts and outcomes. Results Through a series of comparisons between phase 3 trial results and corresponding, matched long-term follow-on study results, future RWCOs can potentially be simulated in order to set upper and lower bounds with utility for outcomes-based or risk-sharing pharmaceutical pricing market access models. Next steps include expanding and refining the scope of algorithms tested for their predictive utility and validating these models against other matched sets of clinical trial and post-market studies. Conclusions Forecasting and modeling tools that predict RWCOs would allow policy and pricing stakeholders to better understand financial impacts of RWE-based policy decisions and could mitigate stakeholders\u2019 exposure to down-side financial risks.

Methods An electronic search of studies that led to new marketing authorisations in Switzerland between 2010 and 2019 was performed. Studies were evaluated according ESMO-Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (ESMO-MCBS) v1.1, ASCO-Value Framework v2 (ASCO-VF) and OLUtool v2. Substantial benefit for ESMO-MCBS, was defined as a grade A or B for (neo)adjuvant intent and 4 or 5 for palliative intent. For ASCO-VF and OLUtool clinical benefit was defined as score >45 and A or B, respectively. Correlation between the frameworks was calculated with Cohen\u2019s Kappa (\u03ba). Factors associated with clinical benefit were evaluated by logistic regression. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results In the study period, 48 cancer drugs were approved for 92 evaluable indications, based on 100 studies. Of all studies 93% were in the palliative setting and 81% were phase III studies. Ratings for ESMO-MCBS, ASCO-VF and OLUtool could be performed for 100, 86, and 97 studies, respectively. Overall, 39 (39%), 44 (51%), 45 (46%) of the studies showed substantial clinical benefit according to ESMO-MCBS, ASCO-VF, OLUtool criteria, respectively. There was fair concordance between ESMO-MCBS and ASCO-VF in the palliative setting (\u03ba = 0.31, p=0.004) and moderate concordance between ESMO-MCBS and OLUtool (\u03ba = 0.41, p<0.001).

Here we focus on the German Federal Joint Committee (Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss, GBA), the French Haute Autorit\u00e9 de Sant\u00e9 (HAS) and the British National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to identify matched drug pairs as a basis to compare HTA outcomes and to analyze cancer-related HTA results in detail. Methods Data were extracted from all published GBA resolutions from January 2011 \u2013 when the AMNOG legislation was introduced in Germany \u2013 to June 2018, as well as all publicly available HAS reports and NICE single technology appraisals during this period. We compared HTA outcomes of matched pairs overall, and separately for non-cancer and cancer drugs. Then, the potential role of additional attributes with regard to cancer drugs was explored, such as orphan drug designation in Germany, impact of reimbursement rates in France and consideration of end of life (EoL) criteria in England. The relationship between HTA outcomes and attributes was tested for statistical significance with a chi-square test or, if required, Fisher's exact test. Results By pairwise comparison, HTA outcomes (cancer, 58/102; non-cancer, 44/102) showed higher congruence for GBA/HAS (total, 67%; cancer, 72%; non-cancer, 59%) than for GBA/NICE and HAS/NICE (total, 54%; cancer, 57%; non-cancer, 50%). NICE recommended 85/102 (cancer, 42/58; non-cancer, 43/44) technologies, whereas GBA and HAS reported added benefit for 72/102 (cancer, 49/58; non-cancer, 23/44) and 60/102 (cancer, 37/58; non-cancer, 23/44) medicines, respectively. When we tested NICE cancer recommendations for the consideration of EoL criteria, no significant impact was found (p>.05, Fisher's test). In contrast, GBA cancer appraisals are associated with an orphan designation (p<.05, chi-square test), and cancer-related findings for the HAS indicate that the reimbursement rate correlated with the assessment of clinical added value (p<.05, chi-square test). Conclusions Our results confirm that variations in HTA outcomes frequently exist. However, cancer-related HTA results seem to be less divergent compared to non-cancer results.

AMG 160 is a targeted HLE BiTE\u00ae immune therapy that engages patients\u2019 own T cells to kill prostate cancer cells via binding of CD3 on T cells and PSMA on cancer cells. We report preliminary results from the dose exploration portion of an ongoing phase I study of AMG 160 in mCRPC. Methods Eligible patients (pts) had mCRPC refractory to prior novel hormonal therapy and 1\u20132 taxane regimens and evidence of progressive disease. AMG 160 was administered as a short IV infusion Q2W at doses of 0.003\u20130.9 mg. The combination of AMG 160 + pembrolizumab was also evaluated. Study objectives were to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and anti-tumor activity. Results As of 11 May 2020, 32 pts had received \u2265 1 dose of AMG 160 monotherapy at 6 dose levels (DL), and 16 pts were on treatment (6 for \u2265 6 mo). Median (range) age was 65.5 (49\u201378) y; 20 pts (63%) had received > 3 prior lines of therapy. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS), the most common adverse event (27 pts, see Table), presented with fever, transaminitis, and hypotension, occurred primarily in cycles 1\u20132, and was managed with standard mitigation approaches. One treatment-related discontinuation (DL5) and 2 reversible dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were reported: rash (DL3) and GI hemorrhage (DL6). MTD has not been reached. RECIST 1.1 responses among the 18 pts with measurable disease included 1 confirmed PR (DL4), 5 SD, and 5 PD. PSA reductions occurred in 15/24 (63%) evaluable pts; reductions >50% occurred in 6/10 (60%) pts at DL5 and DL6. Overall, 6/22 (27%) pts had confirmed PSA responses: 1 PSA90 (DL4), 3 PSA50 (DL3, DL5, DL6), 2 PSA30 (DL3, DL5). Six pts also received AMG 160 (DL3) + pembrolizumab; no DLTs were reported. Conclusions AMG 160 treatment was tolerable with preliminary efficacy. Further dose exploration is ongoing; results will be updated.

STAMPEDE included a wide range of men with M1 or M0 disease. The LATITUDE trial, in patients with high-burden M1 disease only, reported a similar magnitude of effect to the comparable subset of STAMPEDE pts. We report long-term outcomes in the M1 subset of pts in STAMPEDE. Methods All patients received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Stratified randomization allocated pts 1:1 to ADT alone or adding daily abiraterone acetate 1000mg + prednisolone 5mg (SOC+AAP) continued until PSA, radiological & clinical progression. The primary outcome measure was death from any cause. The data freeze for this long-term analysis was planned for 3yr after the primary survival results when a meaningful increase in data was anticipated. Analyses used Cox proportional hazards & flexible parametric models, adjusted for baseline stratification factors. Results Of 1,917 pts contemporaneously randomized to these groups (Nov-2011 to Jan-2014), 1,003 (52%) had M1 disease. The M1 groups were balanced: median age 67yr; 48% high-burden, 44% low-burden, 8% burden not assessable; 94% newly-diagnosed; median PSA 97ng/ml. Median follow-up had increased from 3.5yr to 6.1yr & number of ADT-only deaths increased by 50%, from 218 previously to 329. With 244 ADT+AAP deaths, the adjusted HR=0\u00b760 (95%CI 0\u00b750\u20140\u00b771; p=0.31x10 -9 ) favouring ADT+AAP, with 5-yr survival improved from 41% ADT-only to 60% ADT+AAP. The relative effect of abiraterone was similar in low-burden (HR=0\u00b755; 95%CI 0\u00b741\u20140\u00b776) and high-burden (HR=0\u00b754; 95%CI 0\u00b743\u20140\u00b769) patients. Median time on ADT+AAP was 2.4yr, with a current maximum of 8.1yr. Toxicity at 4yr post-randomisation was similar, with 16% of patients in each group reporting grade 3 or higher toxicity. Conclusions A sustained and substantial improvement in overall survival of M1 prostate cancer patients was achieved with ADT + abiraterone acetate + prednisolone, irrespective of burden of disease.

EDH may be preventable with adequate support between CH visits but large-scale evaluations of virtual supportive care are limited. Methods We undertook a pragmatic, cluster-randomized trial to examine the effectiveness of pro-active telephone management of toxicities in early stage breast cancer (BC) patients receiving CH at 20 cancer centres in Ontario, Canada. Centres were allocated using a covariate-constrained approach to standardized, nurse-led calls to assess common toxicities at 2 time points following each cycle (intervention), or routine care (control). Participants were all patients with stage I-III BC commencing adjuvant or neo-adjuvant CH at participating centres during the centre recruitment period. A subset of 25 patients from each centre completed patient-reported outcome questionnaires. Cluster-level mean number of EDH visits/patient during the entire CH course, was evaluated using healthcare administrative data. Secondary outcomes included toxicity (NCI PRO CTCAE), self-efficacy (Stanford) and quality of life (QoL; FACTB). Penetration was the percentage of patients who received the intervention at the 10 intervention sites. Results Baseline characteristics of participants, enrolled from 02/16-11/17, were similar in the intervention (n=944) and control groups (n=1214); 22% were older than 65. Most common regimens were AC-paclitaxel (44%) and FEC-docetaxel (26%). Penetration ranged from 50-86%; 47% of patients had at least one EDH during CT. Mean number of ED+H visits/patient was 0.91 (SD=0.40) in the intervention arm and 0.94 (SD=0.28) in the control arm (p=0.94). There were fewer patients with any grade 3 toxicity in the intervention arm (48% vs 58%, p=0.028), especially fatigue and aching muscles and joints. There was no difference in self-efficacy but patients in the intervention arm had smaller decline in the FACT-TOI during treatment (p=0.004). Conclusions Virtual pro-active toxicity management during CH did not lead to fewer EDH but was associated with less grade 3 toxicities and a smaller decline in QoL.

Research on this immunological intersection between malignancies and rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) offers the opportunity for better patient centred care and scientific progress. A registry-based study is an ideal approach to obtain real world data on characteristics and optimal clinical management of rheumatic irAEs. Methods The TRheuMa registry is a prospective long-term observational study of a patient cohort suffering from rheumatic side effects of cancer therapies and is part of the large MalheuR project initiated in July 2018 at the University Hospital Heidelberg to explore interrelations of malignancies and RMDs. Results So far, 57 patients were recruited due to a rheumatic irAE under ICI treatment (nivolumab n=29, pembrolizumab n=26, ipilimumab n=11, PD-L1i n=4, combined ICI n=10). Of these, 45.6% had NSCLC and 40.4% melanoma. 15.8% experienced a flare of a pre-existing RMD, 7.0% an initial manifestation of a classical RMD. De novo irAEs mostly resembled phenotypes of rheumatoid arthritis (15.8%), polymyalgia rheumatica (14.0%) and spondyloarthritis (38.6%), but differed in laboratory findings with elevated CRP-levels in 73.7% (28.1% >50mg/l) and mostly autoantibody negativity. The majority (77.2%) showed signs of inflammation in ultrasound examination with mostly symmetrical (65.9%) synovialitis (72.7%) and/or tenosynovialitis (68.2%). We developed a severity-based treatment algorithm: in 54.4%, \u226410mg prednisone +/- NSAID were sufficient, 12.3% required add-on cs-/bDMARD. ICI-treatment was discontinued in 5 cases (8.8%). Complete remission of melanoma was observed in 39% of patients with irAE vs. 4% in a historical control without irAE. Additional irAEs were observed in 52.2% of melanoma and 15.4% of NSCLC patients. Conclusions Prospective real world data from the TRheuMa-registry show that rheumatic irAEs mostly resemble classical RMDs with some distinct characteristics. Our clinical management strategy was effective and underlines our patient centred approach. Future research agenda includes long-term observation of irAE and specifically oncological outcomes.

Published patient-reported quality of life (QOL) data have been largely limited to phase III trials. The size and heterogeneity of this literature can make patient education about ICIs difficult. The aim of this meta-analysis was to quantitatively summarize change QOL in patients receiving ICI for cancer. Methods Two meta-analyses were conducted on publications of PD-1/PD-L1 and/or CTLA-4 inhibitors that provided mean-level QOL using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and/or EQ-5D. One meta-analysis examined change in QOL in patients treated with ICIs from pre-treatment to follow-up approximately 12-24 weeks later. The second meta-analysis compared QOL at follow-up in ICI versus non-ICI regimens in randomized trials. Moderator analyses examined ICI regimen, comparator regimen, disease site, age, gender, follow-up period, and risk of bias. Results Of 20,323 publications identified, 26 met inclusion criteria. The first meta-analysis, encompassing 26 studies and 6,965 patients, indicated QOL did not change over time in patients treated with ICIs (P > .05). Significant moderators included ICI regimen, cancer type, sex, and risk of bias (P values <.05). In the second meta-analysis of 16 studies and 6,536 patients (ICI n=3,588, non-ICI n=2,948), better QOL was observed in ICI versus non-ICI regimens (P < .05). Significant moderators included ICI regimen, cancer type, age, and risk of bias (P values <.05). Conclusions This study is among the first to quantitatively summarize QOL in patients treated with ICIs. Findings suggest ICI recipients report overall stable QOL and better QOL than patients treated with non-ICI regimens. Results confirm that despite immune-related toxicities, ICIs are generally well-tolerated. Legal entity responsible for the study The authors.

We aim to determine the nutritional status and the prevalence of malnutrition in cancer inpatients as measured by GLIM criteria, and establish the association between malnutrition with the risk of nosocomial infections (NI) and length of hospital stay. Methods Prospective observational study carried out in patients admitted to Oncology Department of General University Hospital of Valencia from November 2019 to March 2020. Nutritional status was evaluated within the first 48 hours after admission. Fat free mass index (FFMI) and phase angle (PA) was measured using a bioelectrical impedance (Akern\u00ae), and muscle function using a Jamar\u00ae handgrip. Sarcopenia was measured using the cut-off values according to EWGSOP2. Results A total of 107 patients were evaluated (mean age 66 years, 66.4% males). Most patients (70.1%) had an advanced disease. On admission, 48 patients (44.9%) presented severe malnutrition and 19 (17.8%) moderate malnutrition based on GLIM criteria. In addition, 77 patients (72%) presented dynapenia and 18 patients (16.8%) sarcopenia. Other parameters of nutritional status were: mean weigh: 67.8 kg, mean BMI: 24 kg/m 2 , mean FFMI: 18.6 kg/m 2  and mean PA: 4.5\u00ba. Mean length of stay was 13.9 days. During admission, 43 patients (40,2%) developed a NI, mostly respiratory tract infections (26 patients). Weigh, BMI and FFMI but not PA was significantly lower in patients who developed a NI (p<0.05 in all cases). The proportion of infections was higher in patients with severe malnutrition (25/48, 52.1%) and moderate malnutrition (8/19, 42.1%) as compared with patients with no malnutrition (10/40, 25%), (p=0,035). NI were more common in patients with sarcopenia (61.1% vs. 36%, p=0,044). Length of stay was longer in infected patients (18.6 vs 10.8 days, p<0,024) but was not related to nutritional status. Conclusions The prevalence of malnutrition in cancer inpatients is high. Malnutrition measured by GLIM criteria and sarcopenia are associated with a high risk of NI. An adequate nutritional evaluation is essential for a timely implementation nutritional support, to avoid malnutrition, sarcopenia and decrease NI. Legal entity responsible for the study The authors.

However, there is limited data about sarcopenia and cardiotoxicity of chemotherapy. The aim of this study is to evaluate relationship between sarcopenia and anthracycline (AC) related cardiotoxicity. Methods Patients who received AC-based chemotherapy between 2014-2018, and had baseline abdominal CT containing both L3-L4 levels for measuring skeletal muscle index (L3-L4 SMI) and psoas muscle index (PMI), and baseline and follow-up echocardiography after AC treatment were included. Sex-specific cutoffs for L3 SMI, L4 SMI and PMI were used for diagnosis of sarcopenia. Cardiotoxicity was defined as development of either systolic dysfunction according to European society of Cardiology (ESC) ejection fraction (EF) criteria, or diastolic dysfunction according to American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) diastolic dysfunction criteria. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine potential predictors of cardiotoxicity. Results A total of 166 patients (75 male, 91 female) were included; 50 (30.1 %) with breast cancer, 82 (49.4 %) with lymphoma, 11 (6.6 %) with sarcoma and 23 (13.9%) with other cancers. Median age was 48 years and median doxorubicin dose was 238 mg/m 2 . Sarcopenia was determined in 33 (19.9 %) according to L3 SMI, in 17 (10.2 %) according to L4 SMI and in 45 (27.1 %) according to PMI. After AC treatment, 27 patients (16.3 %) developed cardiotoxicity; 17 (10.2 %) had systolic dysfunction, 9 (5.4%) had diastolic dysfunction and 1 (0.6 %) had both. After adjustment for age, gender, doxorubicin dose, body mass index, and presence of cardiovascular disease; sarcopenia at any of the three levels was significantly associated with increased risk of cardiotoxicity. (L3 SMI Hazard ratio [HR]= 4.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.66-10.31, p=0.002; L4 SMI HR= 3.65, 95% CI 1.21-11.0, p=0.022; PMI HR= 4.39, 95% CI 1.81-10.65, p=0.001). Conclusions This is the first study demonstrating a significant association between CT-based diagnosis of sarcopenia and anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity. Routine CT scans may help clinicians identify high risk patients in whom closer follow-up or cardioprotective measures should be considered. Legal entity responsible for the study The authors.

Ann Oncol . 2019:30[suppl 5]:LBA9). In this analysis we investigated the impact of veliparib on HRQoL. Methods This double-blind study examined the effect of veliparib (120 mg oral twice daily for 7 days out of each 21-day cycle) added to paclitaxel/carboplatin vs. PPC. HRQoL measures were EORTC-QLQ -C30 and breast cancer (BR23), EQ-5D-5L, and Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF). Responses were obtained on Day 2 Cycle 1, Day 1 Cycle 2, and every other cycle thereafter starting from Cycle 4 plus final and follow-up visit. Data were analyzed only through Day 1 Cycle 30 due to attrition. For each HRQoL domain, mean change in baseline scores, % responders (improved, stable, declined), and median time to symptom worsening were analyzed across study arms. Results 504 pts (VPC 334, PPC 170) were included in the analysis. Improvement from baseline in function, disease and treatment symptom burden, and health state was observed for both study arms, with greater benefits for VPC vs. PPC for pain, pain interference, and breast symptoms. Greater proportion of PPC vs. VPC pts declined in global health status, pain, arm symptoms, breast symptoms and pain interference, but here differences were not significant. Median time (months) to symptom worsening was significantly longer  (P <0.05) for VPC vs. PPC pts for role functioning (8.2 vs. 6.5), physical functioning (8.8 vs. 7.1), constipation (7.7 vs. 6.2), and future perspectives (10.2 vs. 9.0). Conclusions Overall, addition of veliparib to paclitaxel/carboplatin has no detrimental effect on quality of life in pts with gBRCA mutation-associated advanced breast cancer and may be beneficial in some areas of functioning and symptom experience.

Maintaining QoL in pts with MBC who progress through different lines of therapy is an important outcome in clinical trials. In the HER2CLIMB (H2C) study, tucatinib (TUC) + trastuzumab (T) + capecitabine (C) demonstrated statistically significant improvement in progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) over T + C alone. In HER2+ MBC pts with and without BM, TUC + T + C had a manageable safety profile similar to T + C alone. Here we report the impact of TUC on HRQoL, a secondary objective in H2C. Methods Assessment of HRQoL was initiated with protocol version 7, using the EQ-5D-5L which includes a EQ visual analog scale (EQ-VAS) and descriptive system (EQ-5D) of 5 health dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no, slight, moderate, severe, or extreme problems. Data were available from 330 of 612 pts and were collected at Cycles (C) 1, 3-9 (every 2 C; 21 day C), C 12 and beyond (every 3 C), and at 30 day follow-up. TUC and placebo group EQ-5D-5L scores were calculated for each dimension and summarized. HRQoL pt reported outcomes were evaluated using longitudinal and descriptive data analyses. Results In H2C, data from 217 pts on the TUC arm and 113 pts on the placebo arm were available for HRQoL analyses. In all 5 EQ-5D-5L domains, most pts in both arms reported only slight or no problems. Reported moderate, severe, or extreme problems were low and similar between tx arms. No clinically meaningful differences in HRQoL were observed between tx arms. Mean EQ-5D-5L VAS scores were similar between tx arms and stable throughout duration of therapy. Decline on EQ-5D-5L domains and VAS scores were not seen while pts were on therapy. All available QoL data will be presented. Conclusions In H2C, addition of TUC resulted in statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS and OS. Moreover, QoL in pts treated with TUC + T + C was maintained throughout the tx period which was longer compared to pts receiving only T + C. Clinical trial identification NCT02614794.

Pooling the ML trial data enables a robust analysis of QOL that includes pre- and postmenopausal pts receiving different ET combination partners. Methods Health-related QOL and pain were evaluated using EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaires. QOL was assessed for all pts in ML-2, pts receiving treatment as initial ET for ML-3, and pts receiving RIB or placebo (PBO) plus a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor as ET for ML-7. A linear effects model was used to determine least squares (LS) mean change from baseline (BL) in pain and global health status (GHS). Results QOL was assessed in 1528 pts from the ML trials. Time to definitive deterioration (TTDD) \u2265 10% for GHS, pain, and emotional functioning was delayed with RIB. Median TTDD \u2265 10% for GHS was 39.6 mo for RIB and 33.1 mo for PBO (hazard ratio [HR], 0.79 [95% CI, 0.66-0.94]). Median TTDD \u2265 10% for pain was not reached for RIB or PBO (HR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.61-0.97]). Median TTDD \u2265 10% for emotional functioning was 46.9 mo for RIB and 35.9 mo for PBO (HR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.59-0.85]). HRs for TTDD \u2265 10% for social and physical functioning and fatigue favored RIB but had wide 95% CIs (will be reported in detail at the congress). GHS/QOL was maintained from BL during treatment, but decreased at end of treatment (EOT) in both arms (LS mean change from BL at cycle 3 and EOT for RIB vs. PBO: +2.9 vs. +4.8 points and \u22123.7 vs. \u22122.7 points, respectively). Pain was improved from BL to cycle 3, maintained throughout treatment, and worsened at EOT (LS mean change from BL at cycle 3 and EOT for RIB vs. PBO: \u22124.3 vs. \u22123.2 points and +1.0 vs. +1.6 points, respectively). Conclusions In pts receiving first-line ET across the ML trials, RIB delayed deterioration in QOL. TTDD for GHS, pain, and emotional functioning scores was longer with RIB vs. PBO. Overall, this large, robust analysis demonstrated favorable QOL results with the addition of RIB to ET in patients with HR+/HER2\u2212 ABC.

To study this, postmenopausal HR+/HER2\u2013 ABC with  de novo  metastatic disease or relapsing after >12 months of completing \u22655 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy were included in FLIPPER study. Methods In this double-blind phase II study, pts were randomly assigned in 1:1 ratio to F 500mg/P vs. F/PL. Stratification criteria were: visceral vs. non-visceral and recurrent vs. de novo metastatic disease. The primary objective was progression-free survival (PFS) at 1 year (investigator\u2019s assessment by RECIST 1.1). With a sample size of 190 pts and a two-sided alpha of 0.2, the analysis has 80% power to detect a difference between both treatment groups, assuming PFS proportions of 0.545 and 0.695 for F/PL and F/P, respectively (constant HR of 0.6). Results From Feb\u20192016 to Jan\u20192019, 189 pts were randomised (94 F/P, 95 F/PL). Median age was 64 years, 45.5% of pts had  de novo  metastatic disease, 60.3% visceral involvement. The study met the pre-specified primary endpoint: PFS rates at 1-year were 83.5% and 71.9% in F/P and F/PL groups, respectively (HR 0.55; 80% CI 0.36-0.83, p=0.064). Median PFS was 31.8 mo (F/P) vs. 22.0 mo (F/PL) (HR 0.52; 95% CI 0.34-0.78; p=0.002). Overall response rates were 68.3% (F/P) vs. 42.2% (F/PL) (p=0.004). The most frequent G2/4 non-haematological toxicities were diarrhoea (3.2% vs. 2.1%) and fatigue (12.8% vs. 5.3%) with F/P and F/PL, respectively. G3/4 haematological toxicities were neutropenia (64.9% vs. 0%), leukopenia (26.6% vs. 0%) and lymphopenia (14.9% vs. 2.1%). There were no reported cases of febrile neutropenia nor treatment related deaths. OS data are immature. Conclusions P/F significantly improved 1-year PFS rate compared to F/PL in pts with HR+/HER2- endocrine sensitive ABC. P/F also improved median PFS and ORR. These data provide evidence for superiority of F/P vs. F/PL in an ABC population not represented in the pivotal PALOMA3 trial. Clinical trial identification NCT02690480.

MK-4830 catalyzes reprogramming of tumour-associated macrophages, relieving myelosuppression and enhancing T cell function. We present data from the first-in-human phase I dose escalation study (NCT03564691) of MK-4830 and MK-4830 + pembrolizumab (pembro). Methods Pts with advanced solid tumours received MK-4830 IV Q3W at escalating doses alone and with pembro. Primary end points were safety and tolerability. PK was a secondary end point; exploratory objectives included ORR per RECIST v1.1, evaluation of receptor occupancy (RO), and immune correlates of response in blood and tumour. Results Among 84 pts, 50 received MK-4830 monotherapy; 34 received MK-4830 + pembro. Median age was 62 years; 50% previously received \u22653 lines of therapy. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed; maximum-tolerated dose was not reached. Any-grade AEs were consistent with those common to pembro. Treatment-related AEs were reported in 52% of pts; most were grade 1/2. MK-4830 steady-state serum PK at C trough  was achieved at the highest dose levels, at which almost all pts had \u226595% blood RO. Preliminary efficacy data show 11 objective responses, with 2 complete responses and 9 partial responses; 1 response was observed in a patient receiving MK-4830 monotherapy. All responses occurred in heavily pretreated pts, 5 of whom had not had a response to prior anti\u2013PD-1 therapy. Responses were durable; some pts received >1 year of treatment. Pre- and on-treatment (n=15) biopsies enabled a preliminary assessment of correlation between RO and immune cell subsets before and during treatment. Conclusions This first-in-class MK-4830 antibody targeting ILT4 given as monotherapy and in combination with pembro was well tolerated and showed dose-related evidence of target engagement. Durable responses were observed with both MK-4830 alone and with MK-4830 + pembro in heavily pretreated pts, 5 of whom progressed on prior anti\u2013PD-1 therapies. These initial data support the further development of MK-4830 + pembro for pts with advanced solid tumors. Clinical trial identification NCT03564691.

PRS-343, a first-in-class bispecific antibody-Anticalin fusion protein, targets HER2 and costimulatory immune receptor 4-1BB on T cells. Here, we report the results of a phase I trial in patients with HER2+ solid tumors. Methods PRS-343 was evaluated in sequential dose cohorts from 0.0005 to 18 mg/kg i.v. Doses were administered Q3W up to 8mg/kg, while doses at 8mg/kg were also given Q2W and Q1W and doses beyond 8mg/kg were administered Q2W. Primary study objectives included safety, tolerability and RP2D. Secondary objectives included ORR and DCR, PD response and PK profile. PD response (CD8+ T cell IHC) was assessed in tumor biopsies pre-/post-treatment. Results 70 patients enrolled (median age 61 years, 59% female, 83% Caucasian, median of four lines of prior therapy) with GC/GEJ (n=25); BC (n=16); gynecological cancer (n=6); CRC (n=10); BTC (n=5); UC (n=2); melanoma, pancreatic and salivary duct cancer (n=1 each) were treated with PRS-343. Based on PK analyses and kinetics of the CD8+ T cell expansion post-treatment, the minimal active dose was considered to be 2.5 mg/kg. 33 patients treated at active dose levels were evaluable for response with an ORR and DCR of 12% and 52% (3% CR, 9% PR, 40% SD), respectively. All objective responses were observed on the Q2W schedule, at/above doses of 8mg/kg; ORR was 40% and DCR was 70% (10% CR, 30% PR). At active doses, we observed pronounced post-treatment expansion of CD8+ T cells while there was no increase at doses below 2.5mg/kg. This effect was more pronounced in patients with a confirmed PR or prolonged SD. PRS-343 was well tolerated and the most frequent TRAEs were mild to moderate infusion related reaction (25%), nausea (7%), arthralgia (5%), vomiting (4%), chills (4%), and fatigue (4%). No DLT was noted. We will also present results of a PRS-343/atezolizumab combination trial in HER2+ solid tumors. Conclusions PRS-343 is the first 4-1BB bispecific to demonstrate encouraging evidence of safety and clinical benefit with a correlative PD effect. Based on these data, a phase II trial in gastric/GEJ cancer has been planned in combination with ramucirumab and paclitaxel. Clinical trial identification NCT03330561.

While rare in the advanced setting, most  edPOLE  mut pathogenicity and derived sensitivity to anti-PD-1 (aPD1) agents remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of nivolumab in MMRp tumours with  edPOLE  mut. Methods ACS\u00e9 immunotherapy is a nationwide program launched by the French National Cancer Institute (INCa) and sponsored by the French network of comprehensive cancer centres (Unicancer) investigating the efficacy and tolerance of aPD1 in multiple phase II single arm cohorts in rare tumours. We report here the initial results of the  edPOLE  cohort, which is the first trial selecting patients on a prospective assessment of missense  POLE  mut pathogenicity by an  ad hoc  molecular tumour board. nivolumab (240 mg IV q2w) was administered until disease progression (PD), toxicity or for up to 2 years. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR) assessed by RECIST v1.1 at 12 weeks. Results From Apr 2018 to Jan 2020, 15 pts (mean age, 59 years) were included with colorectal (6), endometrial (4), gastric (2), pancreas (1), biliary (1) and glial (1) tumours. Mean number of previous lines of treatment was 2.7. Median follow up was 74 days (Q1-Q3= 40.5-188.5). At the date of submission, nivolumab safety was in accordance with data reported in other tumour types. ORR at 12 weeks in 10 evaluable patients was 30% (PR: n=3; SD: n=4; PD: n=3). Pathogenicity of  edPOLE  mut was confirmed by the  ad hoc  committee in 7 cases (47%): 2 P286R, 2 N363K, 2 V411L, 1 A463V. In the pathogenic mut group, ORR was 50% (3/6), disease control rate was 83% (5/6) and median progression-free survival (mPFS) was 161 days. Responses were observed in MMRp colorectal and endometrial cancers with P286R and V411L mutations. Conversely, in the non-pathogenic group (n=4), only 2 SD were observed as best response and 2 pts died before first evaluation. mPFS in this group was 47 days. Conclusions We report the first clinical trial assessing aPD1 in  POLE  mutated MMRp tumours. Nivolumab activity appears promising in  edPOLE  mutated MMRp advanced cancer pts but activity is limited to pathogenic mutations, underlining the need for individual mutational functional assessment by a molecular tumour board. We will include the tumour evaluation of the last 5 additional patients at the ESMO 2020 Virtual Congress. Clinical trial identification NCT03012581. Legal entity responsible for the study UNICANCER.

CC-90010 is a potent BET inhibitor that showed promising clinical activity in pts with advanced malignancies. Methods CC-90010-ST-001 is a phase I dose-escalation (part A) and -expansion (part B) study of CC-90010 in pts with advanced STs and R/R diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Eleven dose levels (DLs) and 4 dosing schedules (2 weekly [2 d on/5 d off; 3 d on/4 d off], 1 biweekly [3 d on/11 d off], and 1 monthly [4 d on/24 d off]) were evaluated. Primary objectives were to determine safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and recommended phase II dose (RP2D). Secondary and exploratory objectives were to assess antitumor activity, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics (PD). Results As of 7 Feb 2020, 84 pts were enrolled. In part A, 67 pts had advanced STs and 2 had R/R DLBCL. In part B, 13 pts had R/R DLBCL (1 pt was not treated until after the data cutoff), and 2 had advanced STs. MTDs were identified for 3 of the 4 dosing schedules. The RP2Ds were 30 mg 3 d on/11 d off and 45 mg 4 d on/24 d off. Six pts from part A had dose-limiting toxicities, in all dosing schedules. The most common grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse event (TRAE) was thrombocytopenia (part A=16%, part B=64%). Eight pts (12%) in part A and 4 pts (29%) in part B had serious TRAEs. In part A, 1 pt with progressive grade 2 astrocytoma had a complete response (CR; ongoing in cycle 19), and 1 pt with advanced endometrial carcinoma had a partial response (PR); 10 pts had stable disease (SD) \u22654 cycles, 3 had prolonged SD (19, 20, and 24 mo). In part B, 2 pts with R/R DLBCL had responses (CR and PR). Plasma exposures increased in an \u223c dose-proportional manner across DLs. The terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) of CC-90010 was \u223c60 h. CC-90010 induced \u226550% decrease of the PD biomarker CCR1 at doses \u226525 mg 4 h post last dose. Conclusions CC-90010 was well tolerated and showed antitumor activity in heavily pretreated pts with advanced malignancies. The long t 1/2  and favorable PD profile improved tolerability and enabled less frequent dosing. These results support further evaluation of CC-90010 in STs and R/R DLBCL.

CC-90011 was well tolerated and had promising antitumor activity in pts with advanced unresectable STs and R/R NHL in the dose-escalation part of the CC-90011-ST-001 study. Here we present updated results from the cohort expansion part of the study. Methods Pts in this phase I, dose-escalation (part A) and -expansion (part B), first-in-human study received CC-90011 once/wk (QW) in 28-d cycles. Primary endpoints were safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and recommended phase II dose (RP2D). Secondary and exploratory endpoints included pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary efficacy. Results Sixty-six pts enrolled, 50 in part A (27 with neuroendocrine neoplasms [NENs] and 1 with R/R NHL) and 16 in part B (all with NENs). The RP2D was 60 mg QW. As of 17 Jan 2020, 4 pts (3 with NENs, 1 with R/R NHL) in part A and 2 pts in part B remained on treatment (tx). The primary reason for tx discontinuation was progressive disease (part A, n=38 [76%]; part B, n=12 [75%]). Thrombocytopenia was the most common tx-related adverse event (AE; 47%), and the only serious AE reported in >1 pt in either part of the study; this on-target toxicity was reversible and manageable. AEs led to discontinuation in 3 pts (6%), all in part A. Two pts in part A and 1 in part B died due to underlying disease; there were no deaths due to tx-related AEs. Clinical benefit rate (partial or complete response [CR] or stable disease [SD] \u22654 mo) was 20% (95% CI, 10.0-33.7) in part A and 44% (95% CI, 19.8-70.1) in part B. In part A, the R/R NHL pt achieved a CR (ongoing in cycle 32) and 5 pts with NENs had SD \u22659 cycles, including 2 with SD \u226521 cycles. In part B, 3 pts with NENs had SD \u22659 cycles. Exposure increased proportional to dose. Negligible accumulation of exposure occurred with repeat dosing and systemic exposures at the same dose were similar in parts A and B. Decreased levels of chromogranin A and peripheral blood PD biomarker, MMD, indicated CC-90011 target engagement. Conclusions CC-90011 was well tolerated with favorable PK/PD profiles. Promising antitumor activity was observed in pts with NENs and R/R NHL. Clinical trial identification Study ID: CC-90011-ST-001 NCT02875223.

We systematically and comprehensively identified and assessed factors associated with high mortality (M) in the largest cohort of pts with cancer and COVID-19. Methods CCC19 cohort includes pts with active or prior cancer and COVID-19 across US/international sites and collaborates with ESMO-CoCARE. Analysis was limited to lab-confirmed COVID-19. Primary endpoint: all-cause 30-day M. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess association between 30-day M and  a priori  identified demographic/clinicopathologic risk factors (age, sex, race, region, smoking, obesity, comorbidities, ECOG PS, cancer status, recent [in 3 months] cancer treatment, cancer type, baseline COVID19 severity). Exploratory analysis used separate models adjusted for demographic/clinicopathologic factors to assess associations of lab parameters with 30-day M. Results As of 31 July 2020, 4169 pts have been accrued; median follow-up 30 days (IQR 21-70), median age 66 (IQR 56-76), 50% men, 92% from US, breast and prostate cancer were most common; 38% had active cancer, 56% required hospitalization and 16% ICU. In 3830 pts with lab confirmed COVID19, 30-day M was 14% overall and 23% in hospitalized pts. Table shows adjusted [a]OR for overall and hospitalized pts.

While there is accumulating information on the antibody response against SARS-CoV-2, less is known about the SARS-CoV-2 antigens that are targeted by CD8 T cells. Such knowledge will be of high value to gain fundamental insights into the antigenic landscape of SARS-CoV-2 recognized by CD8 T cells, to develop tool allowing focused analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses directly ex vivo, and to understand whether current vaccine designs are covering the CD8 T cell recognized antigens. Methods To address this issue, we have analyzed samples from 18 COVID-19 patients for CD8 T cell recognition of 500 predicted SARS-CoV-2-derived epitopes restricted to 10 common HLA-A and HLA-B alleles. For each HLA allele, the top 50 epitopes were selected based on predicted binding affinity and likelihood of successful proteasomal processing. To probe for CD8 T cell recognition of the selected epitope-HLA complexes, we made use of our in-house technology based on multiplexing of peptide HLA (pHLA) multimers conjugated to fluorescent dyes. Results In addition to previous studies showing CD8 T cell reactivity towards epitopes derived from the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, we have identified several CD8 T cell recognized epitopes derived from the ORF1ab, including one epitope displaying clear immunodominant properties across patients positive for HLA-A*01:01. Investigation of the functional status of part of the identified responses (including 4 responses specific for the immunodominant epitope) revealed that the T cell responses were highly dysfunctional. In addition the SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8 T cell responses displayed an increased expression of NKG2A in comparison with bulk CD8 T cells, which may explain their dysfunctional state. Conclusions Our data suggest that part of the ORF1ab encodes multiple CD8 T cell antigens including one immunodominant epitope. Noteworthy these epitopes were derived from a part of the viral genome that is not included in the majority of vaccine candidates in development, and this may potentially influence their clinical activity and safety profile.

However, the ways in which it has done so and the associated impact at the individual and societal levels remains poorly defined. Methods CCOS is a multicenter prospective cohort study designed to define the impact of the pandemic on cancer care delivery and outcomes. The CCOS cohort comprised consecutive outpatients with cancer seen at two US cancer centers from March 2 to March 6, 2020 (index visit). Data was collected at baseline, retrospectively from the preceding 3 months, and prospectively at 3-month follow up. Per patient changes in numbers of visits were compared using Wilcoxon signed rank tests. Correlates of increases in telehealth visits and decreases in in-person visits were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression models. Adjusted Odds ratios [aOR] and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported. Results Of 2365 included patients, 1219 (51.6%) had a decrease in in-person visit frequency during the pandemic period relative to the preceding 3 months. Conversely, 760 (32.2%) had an increased frequency of telehealth visits (decrease in in-person and increase in telehealth visits; both p<0.01). 128 (5.4%) patients developed COVID-19. Compared to White patients, Black and Hispanic patients were less likely to have telehealth visits, had no significant change in frequency of in-person visits, and were more likely to develop COVID-19 (Table).

This risk may be attributable to age, comorbidities, smoking history, pulmonary disease burden and cancer-directed therapies. Methods TERAVOLT is a global consortium examining outcomes and assessing risk factors associated with mortality of patients with thoracic malignancies and COVID-19 infection. Results As of July 15, 2020, 1012 patients from 20 countries have been entered; median age was 68 with 58 % male, 80% current/former smokers, most common comorbidities of HTN (49%) & COPD (26%); 82% NSCLC, 68 % patients with stage IV disease at COVID diagnosis, 65% on treatment (38% chemotherapy, 26% immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), 16 % targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). Of these, 72% were hospitalized; 56% of patients developed complications, most frequently pneumonia (40%) and 47% who did not have prior oxygen therapy required it. 32% of patients died during their COVID-19 infection. Only 33 % of patients continued their oncology treatment after infection. Patients presenting with pneumonia (OR 2.7 2-3.5), consolidation (OR 2 CI 1,5-2,8), bilateral lung abnormalities (OR 2,8 CI 2-3,9) and pleural effusion (OR 2,7 CI 1,8-4) were at increased risk of mortality. In multivariate analysis age \u2265 65 (OR 1,53 CI 1,11-2,1), active smoking (OR 2 CI 1,3-3), higher stage of cancer (OR 1,9 CI 1,3-2,7), ECOG PS \u22652 (OR 3,7 CI 2,7-5), steroids prior to COVID diagnosis (OR 1,8 CI 1,2-2,7), were associated with increased risk of death, while chemotherapy and TKI therapy use were not and interestingly patients on immunotherapy appeared to be at decreased risk for mortality (OR 0,6 CI 0,5-0,97). Conclusions Facing this ongoing global pandemic, TERAVOLT is the largest thoracic malignancy database confirming the high risk for COVID-19 mortality in this specific patient group. Physicians need to evaluate the risk of mortality from COVID-19 based on age, smoking status, stage of cancer, performance status, need for steroids and specific therapy in order to determine the appropriateness for cancer therapy and tailor patient care taking into account patients\u2019 wishes and status of pandemic in the country.

Here we report the results of pembrolizumab in the rare sarcoma cohort. Methods Selected histotypes were all rare sarcomas (incidence <0.2/100,000/year). Main inclusion criteria were age>18, PS\u22641, and advanced disease resistant to standard treatment. Patients received pembrolizumab 200 mg IV as a 30-minute infusion on Day 1 of every 21-day cycle for a maximum of 2 years. The primary endpoint was the confirmed objective response rate according to RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints included clinical benefit rate, duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. Five groups of patients were distinguished, namely chordoma, alveolar soft-part sarcoma (ASPS), desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT), smarca4-malignant rhabdoid tumor (SMBT) and the others. Results 80 patients with rare sarcomas, including 24 with chordoma, 13 ASPS, 6 DSCRCT, 6 SMBT and 31 with other histotypes, were included from July 2017 to February 2020. The median number of cycles was 5 (range, 1 to 33) with 54 (67.5%) patients who discontinued the trial after a median of 4 cycles. Twenty-eight patients died after a median of 3 cycles (linked to cancer 27, other 1). Best response was PR in 13 patients (16.25%, 95%CI: 8.9 to 26.2%), and SD in 29 (36.25%). The occurrence of best response depended on the histotype, with 2 (8%) responses in chordoma, 5 (39%) in ASPS, 1 (17%) in DSCRCT, 3 (50%) in SMBT, and 2 (6%) in other histotypes (p=0.010). At data cut off, the 1-year PFS rates of the five histotype groups were 35%, 58%, 0, 62.5%, and 8%, with median times of 5.7 months, 14 months, 5, not reached, and 2.7 months respectively (p= 0.00016), while 1-year OS rates were 72%, 90%, 50%, 83% and 40% (p= 0.02). Median survival were only reached for chordoma (20 months), DSRCT (7.4 months), and other histotype group (5.4 months).

We report results of a multicenter phase Ib study assessing safety and preliminary efficacy of T combined with the PDL1 inhibitor durvalumab (D) in patients (pts) with unresectable or metastatic STS and relapsed OC, focusing on the STS expansion cohort. Methods This trial followed a conventional 3+3 design and included two dose-expansion cohorts (STS and OC). Pts aged >18, with unresectable or metastatic pretreated STS or relapsed OC were eligible. Primary objective was to assess safety, dose limiting toxicities (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose of T given on day 1 as 3-hour infusion combined with D at fixed dose of 1120 mg on day 2, every 3 weeks. Three dose levels were investigated: 1 mg/m2, 1.2 mg/m2 and 1.5 mg/m2. Secondary objectives comprised antitumor activity of the combination in terms of objective response (OR) rate, 6-month progression-free rate (PFR), progression-free survival (as per RECIST v.1.1) and overall survival (OS), and to explore immune biomarkers of T+D activity on serial tumor biopsies and metabolomics on plasma samples. At least one OR was needed to consider the combination active. Results Between October 2017 and November 2019, 40 pts were included: nine in the dose escalation phase (3 at 1.0 mg/m2 and 6 at 1.2 mg/m2), 15 in the OC cohort and 16 in the STS cohort. With one DLT (grade 4 ALT increase), 1.2 mg/m2 was considered the MTD of T combined with 1120mg/m2 of D. In the STS expansion cohort, median follow-up was 10.7 months (IC95%: 3.1-13.5). Overall, 16 patients were assessable for safety and 14 for efficacy. Most frequent related AE were grade 1-2 nausea (15.1%), grade 1-2 fatigue (11.3%) Eight patients (50%) had drug-related grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs), mostly being neutrophil count decreased (35.7%), and there were 2 grade 5 AE (multi-organ failure and febrile aplasia). Six patients (42.9%) experienced tumor shrinkage, resulting in one partial response (ORR = 7.1%; CI95%: 0.2 - 33.9).The 6-month PFR was 28.6% (CI95%: 8.4 - 58.1).

We report here the ES cohort results. Methods Key-eligibility criteria were histologically confirmed diagnosis of bone ES, age \u226510 years, confirmed measurable PD not amenable to curative-intent, 1-2 previous chemotherapy (CT) regimens for metastatic disease, ECOG 0-1. Eligible ES pts were randomized (2:1) to receive either REG (160 mg/d, 21/28 d) or matched PL with optional cross-over at the time of centrally confirmed progressive disease (PD). 24 pts were planned in the REG arm based on a A'Hern's single-stage design for phase II trials (1-sided \u03b1=0.05, and 80% power) to detect a 27% improvement in the progression-free rate (PFR) at 8 weeks (P 0 =40%) as evaluated by central review per RECIST1.1. Secondary endpoints included PFS, OS and safety. Results From September 2014 to November 2019, 41 ES pts were included. Five pts were not eligible for efficacy analysis. Of 36 efficacy-evaluable pts (13 in PL arm and 23 in REG arm); 28 were men, median age was 32 (16-59) years. 13/23 pts in REG arm (56.5%; one-sided CI95% = [37.5-[) were non-progressive at 8 weeks vs. 1/13 pts in PL arm (7.7%; CI95% = [0.4-[). Median PFS was 11.4 (CI95% = 4.6-22.9) vs. 3.9 (CI95%= 3.3-7.3) weeks for REG and PL arms, respectively. 5 (21.7%) partial responses were observed on REG. Median OS was 34.9 (CI95%=17.6-58.7) and 30.4 (CI95%=10.0-NE) weeks for REG and PL arms, respectively. Ten out of 13 pts crossed-over to REG after centrally-confirmed PD on PL. The most common \u2265 Gr3 REG-related AEs during the double blind period were diarrhea (13%), hand-foot skin reaction (13%), asthenia (9%), thrombocytopenia (9%), mucosal inflammation (9%) and febrile neutropenia (9%), with one toxic death due to thrombocytopenia. Conclusions Despite a PFR at 8 weeks lower than expected, this randomized non comparative study shows a promising signal of benefit of REG in relapsed ES, with a median of PFS of 11.4 weeks, and a moderate toxicity.

Chimeric oncoproteins encoded by fusions of the EWS gene and one of five different ETS transcription factors are dominant drivers of the disease. TK216 was designed to bind ETS proteins directly, disrupt protein interactions, inhibit transcription factor function and cause apoptotic cell death. Notably, TK216 plus vincristine (VCR) was shown to exert synergistic activity (Zollner 2017). Here, we report the results of the phase I trial of TK216 in ES. Methods TK216 was administered by continuous IV infusion to adult and pediatric patients (pts) with relapsed / refractory ES in a phase I study using a 3+3 design. Dosing duration of 7 days was later extended to 10 and 14 days, with a 14-day break to complete a cycle (C). DLT was evaluated during C1, and efficacy was evaluated after completion of C2. VCR could be added to treatment after C2. Results 32 pts were enrolled into 9 dose and schedule escalation cohorts (Coh) of TK216 ranging from 18 to 288 mg/m 2 /day. The MTD for the 14-day infusion was 200 mg/m 2 /d, which was selected as the recommended phase II dose (RP2D). Treatments were manageable with DLTs of neutropenia/febrile neutropenia, and other AEs of thrombocytopenia, anemia and fatigue. Nine pts have been treated in the expansion Coh with TK216 at the RP2D plus VCR. No new toxicities were noted except neurotoxicity due to VCR. In total, 11 pts were treated with the RP2D, 3 in the final dose escalation Coh and 8 in the expansion Coh, as of May 11, 2020. Observed efficacy was partial response (PR) 18% (2/11), stable disease 45% (5/11), for an overall clinical benefit rate of 64% (7/11). 3 of the patients experienced PD before reaching C2 evaluation (overall PD 36% (4/11). The two clinical responses were notable. One pt had a PR with a regression of all target lung lesions after 2 cycles of TK216 alone. After 6 mos of TK216 +/- VCR therapy, a small residual lesion was removed, for a surgical CR, now continuing for 14+ mos. A second pt had a PR with 90% reduction of target lung lesions by RECIST 1.1 after 2 cycles of TK216 plus VCR. Conclusions TK216 was well tolerated and showed encouraging early evidence of anti-tumor activity in a patient population with limited or no treatment options.

Therefore, combination strategies are being pursued to further improve outcome. Sym021 is a humanized, effector-function silenced anti-PD-1 IgG1 mAb. Preclinical models demonstrate that Sym021 combined with Abs targeting other checkpoints (e.g., Sym022, anti-LAG-3; Sym023, anti-TIM-3) results in enhanced immunostimulatory and antitumor activity. We present here first-in-human studies of Sym021, Sym022, and Sym023 alone and Sym021 in combination with either Sym022 or Sym023. Methods Safety, tolerability, and activity of single agent Sym021, Sym022, or Sym023 and combinations were evaluated at escalating doses up to 10-20 mg/kg on a Q2W schedule in patients (pts) with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas. Samples were collected for assessment of PK profiles, immunogenicity, and pharmacodynamic markers in all pts. Results Dose escalation studies of Sym021, 022, and 023 as single agents have been completed. The MTD was not reached for any single agent. The Sym021 dose was fixed at 3 mg/kg based on PK/PD analysis for subsequent dose escalation in combination with Sym022 or Sym023. The MTD was not reached for either combination.

MGD019 enhances  in vitro  T-cell responses to levels achieved by a combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab replicas. MGD019 was well tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys, with biological evidence of CTLA-4 antagonism but a safety profile similar to PD-1 blockade alone. MGD019 may offer risk/benefit improvements vs PD-1 plus CTLA-4 combinations. Methods This study characterizes safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicities, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), PK/PD, and preliminary antitumor activity of MGD019 in patients (pts) with advanced solid tumors. Dose Escalation enrolled pts in a 3+3+3 design up to 10 mg/kg. Cohort Expansion will further characterize safety and antitumor activity per RECIST v1.1 in pts treated at the MTD/MAD. Results At data-cutoff, 33 pts (39% checkpoint-experienced, 3 median prior lines of therapy) were treated in Dose Escalation from 0.03 to 10 mg/kg. No MTD was defined. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 26/33 (78.8%) pts, most commonly fatigue (24%), nausea, arthralgia, pruritus, and rash (18% each). The rate of Grade \u2265 3 TRAEs was 24.2%. Immune-related SAEs included enteritis, enterocolitis, pneumonitis, and myocarditis (n=1 each). Half-life was 12 days; full on-target binding to circulating T cells sustained through trough was observed at doses \u2265 3.0 mg every 3 weeks. Among 25 response-evaluable pts, 4 objective responses were observed (microsatellite stable colorectal cancer, metastatic thymoma [both confirmed PRs], anti-PD-L1-refractory serous fallopian tube carcinoma [unconfirmed PR with >50% reduction of CA-125], and prostatic adenocarcinoma [confirmed CR with resolution of PSA]); 9 pts had stable disease. Dose-dependent ICOS upregulation on circulating CD4+ T cells was evident, consistent with CTLA-4 engagement. Potential correlative biomarkers are being investigated. Conclusions MGD019 has demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and encouraging early evidence of anti-tumor activity. Clinical trial identification NCT03761017.

Platinum/pemetrexed chemotherapy is standard, although a phase 3 trial evaluating nivolumab plus ipilimumab in previously untreated pts with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) recently disclosed statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) compared to chemotherapy. Furthermore, dual blockade of PD-1 and CTLA-4 in pts with recurrent MPM can result in improved disease control (DCR at 12 weeks 50%) but are limited by high rates of toxicity (26% Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events [TRAE]). Here, we present initial safety and efficacy data for AK104, a bispecific antibody targeting PD-1 and CTLA-4, in mesothelioma pts who have failed prior systemic therapies. Methods Pts with mesothelioma relapsed or refractory to at least first line chemotherapy were enrolled in an ongoing phase 1a/1b study of AK104-101 in advanced solid tumors (NCT03261011). Tumor assessments based on RECIST 1.1 were performed once every 2 cycles/8 weeks. Results As of 06 May 2020, 18 mesothelioma pts have been enrolled. Tumor assessment data was available for 13 pts enrolled in dose escalation cohorts at 4 mg/kg, 6 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg and 450 mg AK104 Q2W IV (28-day cycles), of which 12 were na\u00efve to prior anti-PD-(L)1 therapy while 1 had prior anti-PD-1 treatment. Confirmed objective response rate (ORR) was 15.4% (2/13; duration of response [DoR]: 3.6+ and 12.9 months) and DCR at 8 weeks was 84.6% (11/13). Tumor shrinkage was observed in 7 pts (53.8%). Progression free survival at 6 months was 64.5%. Duration of stable disease for the pt (6mg/kg Q2W) who had prior anti-PD-1 therapy was 7.2 months. Three out of 18 pts (16.7%) had a Grade 3-4 TRAE (fever, type 1 diabetes mellitus and infusion-related reaction [IRR]); and another 9 subjects experienced Grade 1-2 TRAEs. Most commonly reported TRAEs were rash in 6 pts and IRRs in 5 pts (Grade 1-2 in 4 pts). Conclusions The initial results from Study AK104-101 suggest that AK104 is well-tolerated and possesses encouraging antitumor activity against mesothelioma. AK104 for the treatment of mesothelioma should be further evaluated. Clinical trial identification NCT03261011. Legal entity responsible for the study Akesobio Australia Pty Ltd.

LBA76). Here we report results from a parallel study of surufatinib in pancreatic NETs (pNETs). Methods The study evaluated the efficacy and safety of S in Pts with well-differentiated (pathological grade 1 or 2), progressive, unresectable or metastatic pNETs. Pts were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive S or P, 300 mg, orally, once daily, until disease progression or intolerable adverse events. Crossover at disease progression was allowed. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS). Results By the cutoff date on 11 November 2019 for the pre-planned interim analysis, 172 Pts were randomized, 113 pts to S and 59 to P. Baseline characteristics were well balanced. The study met the primary endpoint; investigator-assessed median PFS was 10.9 vs. 3.7 months in S and P arms, respectively, with hazard ratio (HR)=0.491; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.319\u20130.755; p=0.0011. Analysis by a blinded independent radiology committee confirmed PFS improvement (13.9 vs. 4.6 months; HR=0.339; 95% CI: 0.209\u20130.549; p<0.0001). The investigator-assessed objective response rate was 19.2% with S and 1.9% with P (p=0.0021). Most common (\u22655% in either arm) grade \u22653 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were hypertension (38.9% in S arm vs. 8.5% in P arm), proteinuria (9.7% vs. 1.7%), hypertriglyceridaemia (7.1% vs. 0), alanine aminotransferase increased and gamma-glutamyltransferase increased (both 2.7% vs. 5.1%). TEAEs leading to drug discontinuation occurred in 10.6% pts vs. 6.8% pts in S and P arm respectively. Conclusions Surufatinib significantly improved the PFS in Pts with progressive, well-differentiated advanced pNETs. The safety profile was manageable and consistent with observations in prior studies. Surufatinib represents a promising treatment option in the armamentarium against pNETs.

This phase I/II study evaluates the safety and preliminary efficacy of this agent by adjusting treatment regimen to limit radiation dose to bone marrow and kidneys. Methods Eligibility included progressive grade 1/2 NETs. Phase I comprises parts A and B. Part A involved, subject to toxicity, planned administration of 3 cycles of 4.5 GBq of  177 Lu-satoreotide tetraxetan with a peptide mass of 300 \u03bcg and enrolled 15 patients. After safety evaluation, part B proceeded with the radioactivity/peptide mass ratio per cycle being escalated up to 6.0 GBq/300 \u03bcg or 4.5 GBq/300-1300 \u03bcg; 20 patients were enrolled at the interim analysis (IA) cut-off date. Results Previous treatments of the 35 enrolled patients included surgery (69%), chemotherapy (20%), radiotherapy (14%), and prior or concomitant somatostatin analogues (77%). At the IA cut-off date, 28 had completed treatment, and 7 were still receiving planned cycles. Of these 28 patients, 22 (78.6%) had received 3 cycles with median cumulative radioactivity of \u223c13 GBq, and 6 (21.4%) discontinued treatment. Overall, grade 3/4 related haematological adverse events (AEs) were reported in 12 patients (34.3%) with lymphopenia/decrease in lymphocyte counts in 6 (17.1%), thrombocytopenia/decrease in platelets count in 5 (14.3%), neutropenia in 2 (5.7%) and anemia in 1 (2.9%). No grade 3/4 renal toxicities were reported. For the 20 patients with adequate follow-up, disease control rate (DCR) at 12 months was 90% (95% CI: 68.3% - 98.8%). Conclusions This IA suggests that  177 Lu-satoreotide tetraxetan has an acceptable safety profile in patients with NET using a lower administered activity per cycle than in earlier studies with this agent or current protocols using SSTR2 agonists. Promising efficacy results encourage the pursuit of its development in this indication. Clinical trial identification EudraCT :  2015-002867-41; NCT02592707.

PD-L1 expression did not enrich for efficacy in either primary or secondary endpoints except for C1 group, where irORR was 16% in pts with PD-L1-positive tumors vs. 0% in pts with PD-L1 negative (p=0.033). Most common treatment-related AEs were fatigue (43%), diarrhea (31.7%), pruritus (23.6%), nausea (13.8%), and hypothyroidism (9.8%). Most frequent grade \u22653 treatment-related AEs were liver toxicity (9.7%), diarrhea (6.5%), fatigue and vomiting (2.4% each). Conclusions D+T combination showed modest activity in this heavily pretreated population. In high grade NENs, D+T reached the primary endpoint of increasing OS rate and deserves further evaluation. Objective radiological responses were infrequent. No new safety concerns have been observed in this large population of advanced NENs.

We provide the registrational data for pts with  RET + MTC from the ARROW study. Methods ARROW (75 sites in 11 countries; NCT03037385) consists of a phase I dose escalation to establish the recommended phase II dose (400 mg once daily [QD] orally), and phase II expansion cohorts defined by tumour type and/or RET alteration. Primary phase II objectives are overall response rate (ORR; blinded independent central review per RECIST v1.1) and safety. We report efficacy for response-evaluable pts (REP) with  RET + MTC and safety for all pts who initiated pralsetinib 400 mg QD, both as of data cut-off date 13 Feb 2020. Results In 79 REP with  RET + MTC (mutation: 61% M918T, 28% C634X, 4% V804X, 8% other), ORR was 65% (95% CI, 53\u201375; n=51/79, 5% complete response [CR]; 59% partial response [PR; 1 pending confirmation]). ORR for pts with prior cabozantinib and/or vandetanib (C/V) was 60% (95% CI, 46\u201374; n=32/53; 2% CR; 58% PR [1 pending]) and in treatment-na\u00efve pts ORR was 74% (95% CI, 49\u201391; n=14/19; 5% CR; 68% PR; all confirmed). Disease control rate was 97% (95% CI, 91\u2013100); 99% (78/79) of pts experienced tumour shrinkage. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and duration of response (DOR) were not reached. In pts previously treated with C/V 18-mo PFS was 71% (95% CI, 58\u201385), and 18-mo DOR was 90% (95% CI, 77\u2013100). In treatment-na\u00efve pts, 18-mo PFS was 85% (95% CI, 65\u2013100) and 86% (12/14) of responses were ongoing at data cut-off (up to 15 mo). Responses occurred regardless of  RET  genotypes (somatic or germline), including 5 of 6 pts with V804X gatekeeper mutation. In the safety population (n=438), treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were primarily grade 1\u20132; most common any-grade TRAEs were increased aspartate aminotransferase (34%), anaemia (24%), increased alanine aminotransferase (23%), constipation (23%) and hypertension (22%). 4% of pts discontinued due to TRAEs. Conclusions Pralsetinib demonstrated potent and durable clinical activity in  RET + MTC regardless of prior treatment with approved multikinase inhibitors or  RET -mutation and was well tolerated.

Here, we present durability of clinical benefit and biomarker data in pts with NSCLC. Methods Key eligibility criteria include  KRAS p.G12C  mutation and prior systemic anticancer treatment (tx). Primary endpoint is safety; key secondary endpoints include objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DOR), and progression-free survival (PFS).  KRAS p.G12C  mutant allele frequency (MAF) and PD-L1 level were examined. Results As of July 17, 2019, 40 pts with NSCLC (22 female [55.0%], median age: 68.0 years [range: 49-77]) were enrolled. Data cutoff date was March 25, 2020. 31 (77.5%) and 19 pts (47.5%) received \u2265 2 and 3 prior lines of therapy, respectively. Median follow-up was 10.2 (range: 8.3\u201319.0) months (mos). 3 pts (7.5%) had adverse events leading to discontinuation. There were no dose-limiting toxicities or fatal tx-related adverse events. Median PFS for all pts was 6.9 (range: 1.2\u201313.9) mos. ORR was 30% (95% Cl, 16.56\u201346.53). DOR ranged from 1.6 (+) to 12.7 mos, with 7 of 12 responders still in response at data cutoff. DCR was 92.5% (95% Cl, 79.61\u201398.43). 18 pts (45.0%) had progressive disease. At data cutoff, 10 pts (25.0%) were on study without disease progression, and 9 pts (22.5%) died. 18 pts (45.0%) (5 partial response (PR), 12 stable disease (SD), 1 progressive disease (PD)) had  KRAS p.G12C  MAF data available. There was no significant association between  KRAS p.G12C  MAF and response (Wilcoxon P = 0.80 for PR vs SD). 11 pts (27.5%) had PD-L1 data available. The median PD-L1 tumor proportion score [TPS] was 3% (range: 1\u20135) in 2 pts with PR, 0% (range: 0\u20130) in 8 pts with SD, and 75% (range: 75\u201375) in the pt with PD (Wilcoxon  P  = 0.044 for PR vs. SD). Conclusions In pts with heavily pretreated NSCLC, durable responses to sotorasib were seen, with the majority of pts achieving disease control leading to a median PFS of 6.9 months. The current limited dataset suggests that neither  KRAS p.G12C  MAF nor PD-L1 expression level predicts response to sotorasib. Clinical trial identification NCT03600883.

We present the safety and early efficacy results of patients receiving amivantamab in combination with lazertinib in the phase 1 CHRYSALIS study (NCT02609776). Methods Patients with EGFR Exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were enrolled in this 2-part study. To identify the recommended phase 2 combination dose (RP2CD), Part 1 enrolled patients without restriction on prior therapy to evaluate escalating dose cohorts of amivantamab (700\u20131050 mg, iv once weekly for 28 days; biweekly thereafter) in combination with standard monotherapy dosing of lazertinib (240 mg oral daily). The ongoing Part 2 dose expansion Cohort E is evaluating preliminary efficacy, without biomarker selection, in patients progressing on osimertinib. Response was assessed by investigator per RECIST v1.1. Results As of 17 March 2020, 71 patients received the combination: median age was 61 y (36\u201379), median prior lines was 1 (0\u20139). In Part 1, the RP2CD was the maximally assessed doses of 1050 mg (1400 mg, \u226580 kg) amivantamab + 240 mg lazertinib. Interim safety profile includes rash (78%), infusion related reaction (61%), paronychia (42%), stomatitis (31%), pruritus (24%), and diarrhea (14%). Majority of treatment-related AEs were grade 1\u20132, with grade \u22653 reported in 7%. As of 30 April 2020, in 23 Part 1 patients with measurable disease, the overall response rate (ORR) was 43.5% (95% CI, 23.2\u201365.5) with 10 partial responses (PRs), and 9 patients with stable disease (SD); median treatment duration was 8.2 months (0.5\u201310.7), with 13 patients still ongoing. In the post-osimertinib expansion Cohort E, early antitumor activity is being observed in 14/20 response-evaluable patients with 1 complete response, 7 PRs (2 pending confirmation), and 6 SD with tumor shrinkage. Conclusions Amivantamab can be combined safely with lazertinib at their respective full monotherapy doses. Encouraging preliminary activity was observed in osimertinib-relapsed disease: updated data will be presented. Clinical trial identification NCT02609776; submitted November 18, 2015.

ACTIVE is the first phase III study evaluating apatinib, an oral small molecule VEGFR2-TKI, or placebo plus gefitinib as first-line therapy in patients (pts) with EGFRm NSCLC. Methods Treatment-na\u00efve pts with classic EGFR mutation (ex19del or L858R) were randomized (1:1) to receive once-daily oral apatinib 500 mg plus gefitinib 250 mg (AG arm) or placebo plus gefitinib 250 mg (G arm). Stratification factors: EGFR mutation type (ex19del, L858R), sex, and performance status (0, 1). The primary endpoint was PFS (RECIST 1.1) assessed by blinded independent radiology review committee (IRRC). Secondary endpoints: PFS by investigator (INV), OS, ORR, DCR, DOR, TTPD, QoL and safety. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to analyze baseline and post-progression samples for exploring efficacy predictors and acquired resistance. Results 313 pts were enrolled (AG arm, n=157; G arm, n=156). Median follow-up was 15.8 months (IQR 12.6, 20.4). Median PFS by IRCC was 13.7 versus 10.2 months in AG and G arms (HR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.54-0.95; p = 0.0189). Prolonged PFS by INV (HR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.53-0.95) was observed. OS data are immature at cutoff (29.4% events). ORR was 77.1% and 73.7% in AG and G arms (p = 0.5572). Pts with ex19del had better HR than L858R (HR = 0.67, 0.45-0.99; 0.72, 0.48-1.09). NGS results of baseline samples showed a marginally significant improved PFS in  TP53 -mutant disease. Pts with  TP53  exon 8 mutation significantly benefited from dual blockade (HR = 0.24, 0.06-0.91). Grade 3-4 adverse events (AEs) of the two arms were similar, except increased risk of hypertension and proteinuria (46.5%; 17.8%) in AG arm. No AEs beyond expectation were reported. Other endpoints and NGS results for resistance will be presented onsite. Conclusions Apatinib plus gefitinib as first-line therapy demonstrated superior PFS.  TP53  exon 8 mutation status could serve as an efficacy predictor. Safety profiles were consistent with that of the individual drugs and acceptable. Clinical trial identification NCT02824458.

Preclinical study showed the potential of this combination in EGFR T790M mutated model. Thus, to explore the efficacy and safety of osimertinib (Osi) in combination with bevacizumab (Bv) among advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients with EGFR T790M mutation is intriguing. Methods Advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients who progressed with prior EGFR-TKI (other than third generation TKI) and acquired EGFR T790M mutation were randomized to Osi (80mg, p.o., everyday) or Osi+Bv (15mg/kg, div, every 3 weeks) in a 1:1 ratio. Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints consisted of overall response rate (ORR), time to treatment failure (TTF), overall survival (OS) and safety (Trial Identifier, UMIN000023761). Based on the hypothesis that Osi+Bv will provide a 0.55 improvement in PFS over Osi alone with median PFS of 9 months, the planned sample size was 80 to provide a power of 80% at two-sided significance level of 20%. Results Between Aug 2017 and Sep 2018, 81 patients were randomized (41 in Osi and 40 in Osi+Bv). Of those, median age was 68 (range, 41-82); male, 41%; c-stage III/IV/recurrence, 7/70/22%; PS 0/1, 46/54%; with brain metastasis, 26%; prior history of cytotoxic chemotherapy; 21%. Baseline characteristics were similar between the arms. Although ORR was better in Osi+Bv than Osi (68 % vs 54%), median PFS was shorter in Osi+Bv (9.4 months vs 13.5 months, HR 1.44 [95%CI, 1.00-2.08], p = 0.20). Median TTF was also shorter in Osi+Bv (8.4 months vs 11.2 months, HR 1.54, p = 0.12) and OS was similar (median not reached vs 22.1 months, p = 0.96). In Osi+Bv arm, common adverse events \u2265Gr 3 were proteinuria (23%), hypertension (20%) and infection (10%). Conclusions Compared with Osi, Osi+Bv failed to show prolongation of PFS in advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients with EGFR T790M mutation. Clinical trial identification UMIN000023761.

IMpassion031 is a global, phase III, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study in pts with high-risk primary invasive eTNBC evaluating the efficacy and safety of neoadj atezolizumab (A) or placebo (P) with  nab -paclitaxel (nP) followed by A or P with dose-dense doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide. Here, we report the primary analysis of IMpassion031. Methods Eligible pts were \u2265 18 years old with previously untreated, centrally confirmed, invasive stage II-III eTNBC and tumour size > 2 cm. Pts (n = 333) were randomized 1:1 to receive A 840 mg or P q2w + nP 125 mg/m 2  qw for 6 doses of A followed by A 840 mg or P q2w + doxorubicin 60 mg/m 2  + cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m 2  q2w for 4 doses of A followed by surgery. After surgery, pathologic complete response (pCR; ypT0/isN0) was assessed in all pts and investigators were unblinded to study treatment. Stratification was by diagnosis stage (II vs III) and PD-L1 expression on tumour-infiltrating immune cells (IC; \u2265 1% vs < 1%). Co-primary endpoints were locally assessed pCR in ITT or PD-L1+ (PD-L1 IC \u2265 1%) pts. Event-free survival (EFS) was a secondary endpoint. Safety was assessed. Results 333 pts were assigned to A-chemo (n = 165) or P-chemo (n = 168). Median follow-up was 20.6 mos in the A-chemo arm and 19.8 mos in the P-chemo arm (data cutoff 3 Apr 2020). pCR was seen in 57.6% (95% CI: 49.7, 65.2) of pts in the A-chemo arm and 41.1% (33.6, 48.9) in the P-chemo arm (\u039416.5%; 5.9, 27.1; 1-sided  P  = 0.0044 [significance boundary, 0.0184],  P  = 0.0085 for the intersection hypothesis of ITT and PD-L1+ populations). In PD-L1+ pts (n=152), pCR was seen in 68.8% (57.3, 78.9) vs 49.3% (37.6, 61.1) of pts (\u039419.5%; 4.2, 34.8; 1-sided  P  = 0.021; not significant). Median EFS was not reached in either arm (HR, 0.76; 95% CI: 0.40, 1.44). In the neoadj phase, Grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) were balanced, treatment-related serious AEs occurred in 22.6% (A-chemo) and 15.6% (P-chemo), and 1 pt per arm had an unrelated Grade 5 AE. Conclusions In pts with eTNBC, A + neoadj chemo significantly improved pCR rates regardless of PD-L1 status with an acceptable safety profile. Clinical trial identification NCT03197935.

Increasing stromal tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) have been associated with improved outcome. However, limited data are available for young patients. We investigated whether TIL could aid in identifying a subgroup of young TNBC patients for whom de-escalating (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy could be considered. Methods All women <40 years, diagnosed with TanyN0M0 breast cancer between 1989 and 2000 were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. We excluded women who received adjuvant systemic treatment. ER, PgR, and HER2 status were reassessed and TIL were scored for the triple negative (ER/PgR < 10% and HER2 negative) subset according to an established standard. Multivariable Cox regression was performed for overall (OS) and distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS). We used continuous TIL score, T-stage, tumour grade, histological subtype, and local treatment as covariates. For DRFS we censored patients at the time of a second primary tumour. Results We identified 481 TNBC patients, with a median age of 35 years (range 22 \u2013 39). Most tumours were grade 3 (86%), pT1C (49%), median TIL score was 25% (IQR 5 \u2013 70). In total, 122 DRFS events (25%) (89 metastases, 33 deaths), and 170 deaths (35%) occurred during a median of 16.2 and 21.2 years follow-up, respectively. In total, 110 (23%) patients developed a second primary tumour. OS at 10 and 15 years for patients with TIL \u2265 30% and <75% (n=127) was 80% (95% CI 73 - 87) and 76% (95% CI 69 \u2013 84), DRFS was 84% (95% CI 78 \u2013 91) and 83% (95% CI 76 \u2013 90), respectively. For patients with \u2265 75% TIL (n=107) OS and DRFS at 10 and 15 year were 95% (95% CI 91 \u2013 99), 93% (95% CI 89 \u2013 99), 98% (95% CI 95 \u2013 100) and 98% (95% CI 95 \u2013 100), respectively. Risk of death or DRFS event reduced significantly for each 10% TIL increment (aHRs 0.83; 95% CI 0.79-0.88 and 0.74; 95% CI 0.68-0.80, respectively). Conclusions In young (<40 year), systemically untreated, N0, TNBC patients TIL provide important prognostic information. Subsequent investigations to de-escalate systemic therapy in a subgroup of young TNBC patients may be warranted. Legal entity responsible for the study The PARADIGM study group.

Primary endpoint pathological complete response (pCR; ypT0/is ypN0) was comparable in the whole cohort as well as in subgroups (Schneeweiss et al. EJC 2019). Here, we report the secondary endpoints invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) and overall survival (OS). Methods Pts were randomized (stratified by BC subtype, Ki67, lymphocyte-predominant BC) to receive 18 weeks of E (150 mg/m 2 ) followed by P (225 mg/m 2 ) followed by C (2000 mg/m 2 ), each q2w for 3 cycles or weekly P (80 mg/m 2 ) plus M (20 mg/m 2 ) plus, in TNBC, Cb (AUC 1.5). HER2+ BC pts additionally received trastuzumab (6 [loading dose 8]mg/kg q3w) and pertuzumab (420 [840]mg q3w) with all P and C cycles. Adjuvant locoregional and endocrine therapy were given according to national guidelines. Secondary time-to-event endpoints were iDFS and OS. Results Between 12/2014 and 06/2016, a total of 961 pts were randomized and 945 started treatment (iddEPC n=470, PM(Cb) n=475). After a median follow-up of 47.0 (range 1.6-61.5) months, 75 iDFS events in iddEPC and 87 in PM(Cb) were reported. Overall, there was no difference in iDFS (hazard ratio PM(Cb) to iddEPC 1.16, 95%CI 0.85-1.59, p=0.3357) or OS (hazard ratio 0.90, 95%CI 0.58-1.40, p=0.6371) between both arms. In the subgroup of hormone-receptor (HR)+/HER2- BC, iDFS was significantly longer for iddEPC (4-year iDFS 62.5% with PM vs.77.9% with iddEPC; hazard ratio 2.11, 95%CI 1.08-4.10, p=0.0284), translating into an OS benefit (4-year OS 80.1% vs. 94.7%; hazard ratio 3.26, 95%CI 1.06-10.00, p=0.0388). There was no significant difference in survival in HER2+ or TNBC. Conclusions While there was no difference in survival following NACT with iddEPC or PM(Cb) for the entire cohort, the subgroup of HR+/HER2- BC significantly benefits from treatment with iddEPC. This supports the concept of effective therapy beyond pCR in luminal BC pts. Clinical trial identification NCT02125344. Editorial acknowledgement Dr. Bianca Lederer, GBG Forschungs GmbH.

The global PALLAS trial (NCT02513394) was designed to determine if the addition of two years of P to adjuvant ET improves invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) over ET alone in patients (pts) with HR+/HER2- early-stage breast cancer. Methods In this phase III open-label trial, pts with stage II-III HR+/HER2- breast cancer were randomized to receive either 2 years of P with adjuvant ET, or ET alone. Eligible pts were within 12 months of diagnosis and 6 months of initiating adjuvant ET. The primary objective was to compare invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) between arms; secondary objectives include other recurrence endpoints and safety, as well as quality of life, adherence, and translational science. The study had 85% power to detect a 25% improvement in iDFS (0.75 hazard ratio [HR]). Interim analyses (IA) were predefined in the protocol; IA2 was triggered when 67% of events were observed. Results 5,760 pts (median age 52 years) were randomized and included in the analysis; 1,013 (17.6%) had stage IIA disease and 4,729 (82.1%) stages IIB/III. 4,754 (82.5%) had received prior chemotherapy. At IA2, after a median follow-up of 23.7 months (351 events), iDFS was similar between the two arms, with 3-year iDFS of 88.2% for P and ET, and 88.5% for ET alone (HR 0.93, 95% confidence interval 0.76-1.15), crossing a pre-specified futility boundary. No benefit from P was observed within clinicopathologic subgroups. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was more common with P (61.3% vs 0.4%) but febrile neutropenia was uncommon (1.0%). Other all-grade toxicities occurring more often with P included leukopenia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, anemia, upper respiratory tract infection, and alopecia. 42.2% of pts discontinued P prior to the planned 2 year duration, primarily due to adverse events. Conclusions Within the PALLAS trial, at IA2, two years of adjuvant palbociclib with ET did not improve iDFS compared to ET alone. Ongoing long-term follow-up and additional clinical and translational analyses will explore the effect of P in this patient population. Clinical trial identification NCT02513394.

Due to the different pattern of CDK target inhibition, we conducted a similar WOO trial with abemaciclib to determine its antiproliferative effect and to assess differences in GE array pathway analyses with palbociclib. Methods Untreated EBC patients (n=105) were randomized 3:1 to abemaciclib 150mg twice daily for 14 days vs. no treatment. FFPE and frozen samples were taken at baseline and at surgery. Primary objective was antiproliferative response defined as natural logarithm of Ki67 expression at day 15<1. Immunostainings (Ki67, RB, pRB, p16, Cyclin D1, Cyclin E1, Cyclin E2, TILs, CD8+/FOXP3 ratio) and gene expression (GE) arrays were performed pre- and post-treatment. Pooled GE pathway analysis with GE arrays from our WOO trial with palbociclib and comparisons between drugs were performed. Results In the ABC-POP trial, abemaciclib led to significant differences as compared to control in antiproliferative effect (71 vs. 8%; p <0.001) and changes in Ki67 (p<0.0001), pRB (p<0.0001), Cyclin D1 (p=0.047) and Cyclin E2 (p<0.0001) by IHC. No significant predictive biomarkers were identified. Abemaciclib had significant effect on change from baseline in 63 genes mostly associated with cell cycle and proliferation. No genes were significantly associated with abemaciclib antiproliferative effect. In the pooled (N=168) GE pathway analysis with patients from ABC-POP and from the trial with palbociclib, CDK4/6 inhibition was associated to significant effect on E2F, G2M and mitotic spindle pathways. No differential effect on GE pathways was observed between abemaciclib and palbociclib. Conclusions Short-term pre-operative abemaciclib was associated to significant antiproliferative effect as well as a change in cell cycle biomarkers like pRb, Cyclin D1 and Cyclin E2 by IHC and by GE array. Pooled GE pathway analyses with palbociclib treated patients showed significant effect on cell cycle pathways although no significant differences were seen between the two CDK4/6 inhibitors.

In a previous phase II study we found HAIC with FOLFOX yielded a higher treatment response versus TACE in patients with large unresectable HCC. Here we report results from a phase III trial of HAIC with FOLFOX versus TACE. Methods In this randomised, multi-centre, open-label trial, adults (\u226518 years) with a primary unresectable HCC tumour with a largest diameter \u22657 cm, without macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic spread were randomised 1:1 to HAIC (oxaliplatin 130 mg/m 2 , leucovorin 400 mg/m 2 , fluorouracil bolus 400 mg/m 2  on day 1, and fluorouracil infusion 2400 mg/m 2  for 24 hours, every 3 weeks via repeated catheterization) or TACE (50 mg of epirubicin, 50 mg of lobaplatin, and lipiodol and polyvinyl alcohol particles). The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) and secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) using RECIST, progression-free survival (PFS) and safety. Treatment response was also assessed using mRECIST. Treatment outcomes were evaluated in an intention-to-treat population and safety was assessed in patients who received \u22651 cycle of study treatment. Results A total of 315 patients were randomised to HAIC (n=159) or TACE (n=156). The cut-off for the present analysis was April 2020 and patient follow-up is on-going. Median OS was higher for patients receiving HAIC versus TACE: 23.1 months (95% CI, 18.23\u201327.97) versus 16.07 months (95% CI, 14.26\u201317.88); hazard ratio (HR), 0.58 (95% CI, 0.45\u22120.75; P <0.001). Compared with the TACE group, patients in the HAIC group had a higher ORR (RECIST: 45.9 [73] vs. 17.9% [28], P <0.001; mRECIST: 48.4 [77] vs. 32.7% [51], P=0.004), and a longer median PFS (9.63 [95% CI, 7.40\u221211.86] vs. 5.40 [95% CI, 3.82\u22126.98] months; P <0.001). More patients in the HAIC group underwent subsequent resection compared with the TACE group (23.8 [38] vs. 11.5% [18], P=0.004). The incidence of serious adverse events was higher in the TACE group versus the HAIC group (30 vs 19%, P=0.03). Conclusions HAIC with FOLFOX significantly improved OS compared with TACE in patients with unresectable HCC. Clinical trial identification NCT02973685.

D is a human monoclonal antibody (mAb) that inhibits binding PD-L1 to its receptor. T is a mAb directed against CTLA-4. PA.7 is designed to evaluate whether combining PD-L1 and CTLA-4 inhibition with GEM and Nab-P increases treatment efficacy. Methods This randomized phase II study (NCT02879318) assessed the efficacy and safety of GEM, Nab-P, D, and T (arm A) vs GEM and Nab-P (arm B) in patients (pts) with mPDAC (n=191). Pts with untreated mPDAC and good performance status (ECOG PS 0-1) were eligible. A safety run in was conducted for 11 pts receiving GEM, Nab-P, D and T. The study then randomized 180 pts in a 2:1 ratio to receive GEM (1000mg/m2 D1, 8, 15); Nab-P (125mg/m2 D1, 8, 15); D (1500 mg) D1 q 28 days and T (75 mg) D1 for first 4 cycles vs. GEM and Nab-P alone. The primary endpoint is overall survival (OS); secondary endpoints include progression free survival (PFS), safety, overall response rate (ORR) and quality of life. Results 180 pts were randomized (119 to arm A and 61 to arm B) between April 2017 and July 2018. Baseline characteristics were well balanced. With a median (med) follow-up of 28.5 months (mo) there was no significant difference in OS (med 9.8 mo in arm A vs. 8.8 mo in arm B, Hazard Ratio (HR)=0.94, 90% confidence interval (CI) 0.71-1.25, p=0.72). There was no significant difference in PFS (med 5.5 mo vs 5.4 mo respectively, HR=0.98, 90% CI 0.75-1.29, p=0.91). ORR was not significantly different, 30.3% vs. 23.0% respectively (Odds Ratio=1.49, 90% CI 0.81-2.72, p=0.28). Disease control rate (DCR) was 70.6% vs 57.4% respectively (difference=13.2%, 90% CI 0.7-25.7%, p=0.096). The only significant difference in grade 3 or greater adverse events was lymphopenia (38% vs 20% respectively, p=0.02). Conclusions The addition of dual immune checkpoint inhibitors to Gem and Nab-P did not result in a significant improvement in OS, PFS, or ORR. There is a trend to improved DCR. Correlative analyses to assess biomarkers that may predict immune sensitivity in this setting are underway. Clinical trial identification NCT02879318.

Nevertheless, only few data exist on health-related quality of life (QoL) in mPC. receiving first-line systemic chemotherapy. Methods The QOLIXANE-PARAGON study is a prospective, non-interventional, multicenter sub-study of the PARAGON- registry, conducted in Germany and transitioned into a permanent registry for pancreatic cancer pts considering all types of treatments.                    This report focuses on the pts enrolled into the QOLIXANE portion of the study, treated with NPG in 1 st  line. Pts were recruited from 95 German centers. QoL was prospectively measured via EORTC-C30 questionnaires (at baseline and every month thereafter): therapy and efficacy parameters were prospectively collected. QoL and efficacy endpoints were analyzed in the intention-to-treat population (ITT). Main objectives were the rate of patients without deterioration of Global Health Status/QoL (GHS/QoL) at 3 and 6 months. Results 600 pts were enrolled. MPFS was 5.85 months (95% CI, 5.23 to 6.25). MOS was 8.91 mo (95% CI, 7.89 to 10.19). The mOS in ECOG 0 pts. was significantly better (11.18 mo; p = 0.027) than in ECOG 1 pts. (mOS 8.52 mo) and ECOG 2 (mOS 4.80 mo; p <0.0001). Worst mOS was seen in ECOG 3 (mOS 2.94 mo). The KM-analysis showed that 61% and 41% of pts had maintained QoL/GHS after 3 and 6 months, respectively. Median time to deterioration of QoL/GHS was 4.68 months (95% CI, 4.04 to 5.59). Mean QoL/GHS improved from 46.1 (SD 22.7) at baseline to 52.8 (SD 21.3) after 6 months. In the QoL response analysis, 34.6%, 37.4% and 28% of evaluable pts had improved, stable and worse QoL/GHS after 3 months, respectively. In the Cox regression analysis, GHS/QoL scores strongly predicted survival with a HR of 0.86 (p<0.0001). Conclusions QoliXane is the largest study on QoL in mPC and shows that time to deterioration of QoL is short, reflecting the aggressive nature of mPC. Nevertheless, a relevant group of mPC in 1 st  line have improved or maintained QoL after 3 and 6 months, indicating that QoL is a predictor of pts outcome. Clinical trial identification NCT02691052.

Recent studies suggest that the impact of the MGMT status on chemosensitivity may be modulated by telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter hotspot mutations. Methods MGMT promoter methylation and TERT promoter mutation status were assessed in an exploratory prospective cohort of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma patients of the German Glioma Network (GGN) (n=298) and validated in a retrospective cohort from D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, and Zurich, Switzerland (n=302). Results In the GGN discovery cohort of patients with MGMT promoter-unmethylated tumors, TERT promoter mutation showed a trend towards inferior outcome (p=0.085). TERT promoter mutations were not associated with improved outcome in patients with MGMT promoter-methylated tumors. The same patterns were seen when the analysis was restricted to patients intended to be treated with TMZ. Different TERT promoter hotspot mutations were not associated with distinct outcomes. These results were confirmed in the retrospective validation cohort. Conclusions Analysis of two independent cohorts of glioblastoma patients, including the prospective GGN cohort, did not confirm previous data suggesting that TERT promoter mutations confer an enhanced benefit from TMZ in patients with MGMT promoter-methylated glioblastoma. Thus, diagnostic testing for TERT promoter mutations may not be required for prediction of TMZ sensitivity in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma patients. Legal entity responsible for the study The authors.

Quantitative pyrosequencing approach has proven to be feasible for MGMTmet testing but its value is still unclear. We performed a large, multicentre, retrospective study to identify the association between MGMTmet values and clinical outcome. Methods From 9 Italian centres, we collected consecutive GBM PTS with assessment of MGMTmet by pyrosequencing approach evaluating CpGislands from 75 to 84. Other inclusion criteria were: histological diagnosis of GBM, ECOG PS\u22642, therapy with RT+TMZ. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the survival curves, time-dependent ROC curve for defining the optimal cut-off value of mean percentage of MGMTmet in terms of 2y-OS, Cox regression for multivariable analysis, and restricted cubic spline to investigate the non-linear association between methylation values and OS. Results 681 PTS were enrolled; median age was 60 ys; ECOG PS was 0 in 292, 1 in 306, 2 in 83; 391 (58%) had a complete resection. 8% received a second surgery. IDH was mutated in 6%. 2y-OS was 31.6%, median OS 17.4 ms. Median MGMTmet was 3.5% (IQR 0-22%). ROC curve identified a cutoff of 15% of MGMTmet in terms of 2y-OS (sens 78% spec 57% AUC=0.67). 2y-OS was 19.7% and 53.7% for MGMTmet< and \u226515%, respectively (p<0.0001). At multivariable analysis, MGMTmet<15% was associated with impaired survival (HR 2.7 95% CI 2.1-3.4 p<0.00001), adjusting for age, PS, type of surgery and second surgery. A non-linear association between MGMTmet and survival was identified (p<0.0001), with lower values of MGMTmet associated with lower survival; indeed, estimated median OS was lowest (14 ms 2ys-OS 17.4%) with MGMTmet of 4%, 21ms (2yr-OS 40.9%) with MGMTmet of 20%, 27ms (2yr-OS 40.9%) when MGMTmet was 40%, then leveled around 30ms (2yr-OS 54.5-59.8%) when MGMTmet was>40%. Conclusions This study represents one of the largest trials analyzing MGMTmet by pyrosequencing approach. Lower values of MGMTmet were associated with impaired survival and the relationship was non-linear. Noteworthy, we identified a strong prognostic value of MGMTmet which could be used as stratification factor in prospective clinical trials. Legal entity responsible for the study Giuseppe Lombardi.

Therefore, we explored the correlation of the peritumoral edema with tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) density in newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Methods 133 patients (60.9% male; 39.1% female) with histologically verified newly diagnosed glioblastoma were included in this study. The volume of peritumoral non-enhancing T2-hyperintense signal abnormalities was measured to quantify edema and non-enhancing tumor tissue. CD3+, CD8+ and PD-1+ TIL densities were analyzed using immunohistochemistry and tissue phenomics software. Results Median perifocal edema volume was 84200 mm 3  (range: 442.4 \u2013 254700). Median TIL densities were 74.7 cells/mm 2  for CD3+ (range: 3.1 \u2013 1071.4), 29.6 cells/mm 2  for CD8+ (range: 3.0 \u2013 290.3) and 13.6 cells/mm 2  for PD-1+ TILs (range: 1.6 \u2013 141.5). Strong correlation between CD3+ and CD8+ TIL densities was observed (Spearman\u2019s r = 0.784, p < 0.001), furthermore PD-1+ TIL density correlated with CD3+ (r = 0.591, p < 0.001) and CD8+ (r = 0.532, p < 0.001) TIL densities. Larger than median perifocal edema volume correlated with higher CD8+ (p = 0.036) and tendentially higher PD-1+ TIL densities (p = 0.199), but not with CD3+ TIL density (p = 0.883). Among 84 patients with known methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status, 33 (39.3%) patients with MGMT promoter hypermethylation had less perifocal edema than their unmethylated counterparts (n = 51/84, 60.7%; median: 84200 mm 3  vs. 122400 mm 3 ; p = 0.047), while there was no significant difference in CD3+, CD8+ and PD-1+ TIL density according to MGMT promoter methylation status. Conclusions Peritumoral non-enhancing T2-hyperintense signal abnormality volumes correlate with the density of intra-tumoral cytotoxic T cells in newly diagnosed glioblastoma and may serve as \u201cimmuno-radiomic\u201d surrogate parameter.

Methods 6001 patients with newly diagnosed BM treated between 1986-2020 were identified from the Vienna Brain Metastasis Registry. Results Frequency of the primary tumor did not shift over the observation period with lung cancer being the most frequency source of BM (50.5%) followed by breast cancer (16.0%), melanoma (11.1%), colorectal cancer (5.8%), renal cell carcinoma (5.5%) and BM of unknown primary (2.5%). A rising incidence of BM diagnosed by screening in absence of neurological symptoms was found (p<0.001; 1986-1999:15.3%; 2000-2009:25.5%; 2010-2020:31.4%). A significant change in initial BM treatment approaches was observed during the decades (p<0.001): 36.8% of the patients received stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) between 1986-1999, while 56.3% between 2000-2009. Furthermore, an increase in systemic treatment (1986-1999: 0.4%; 2010-2020: 2.4%) and a decrease in neurosurgical resection (1986-1999: 39.3%; 2010-2020: 20.4%) as initial BM treatment approaches were observed. Patients diagnosed with BM between 1986-1999 presented with an unfavorable median overall survival (5 months) compared to patients diagnosed between 2000-2009 and 2010-2020 (7 months, each; p<0.005). Furthermore, the diagnostic- specific graded prognostic assessment (DS-GPA) (Hazard ratio [HR] 1.42; p<0.001), and the GPA for lung cancer using molecular markers (Lung-molGPA) (HR 1.67; p<0.001) and for melanoma using molecular markers (Melanoma-molGPA (HR 1.46; p=0.011) showed statistically significant correlation with overall survival. Conclusions For BM patients, treatment patterns have changed towards increased use of SRS as well as systemic therapies, and survival times have improved over time. Furthermore, our data confirm refinement of BM-specific prognostic scores by incorporation of molecular data. Legal entity responsible for the study The authors. Funding Has not received any funding.

CNS metastases are diagnosed in 10\u201330% of solid tumours and associated with poor outcome. Entrectinib is a CNS-active TRK inhibitor that crosses the blood-brain barrier and has demonstrated systemic and intracranial (IC) efficacy in patients (pts) with  NTRK  fusion-positive (fp) solid tumours in three phase 1/2 clinical trials (ALKA-372-001 [EudraCT 2012-000148-88]; STARTRK-1 [NCT02097810]; STARTRK-2 [NCT02568267]). We report an updated integrated analysis of these entrectinib studies, focussing on IC activity (data cut-off: 31 Oct 2018). Methods Pts with  NTRK- fp solid tumours and baseline CNS metastases (asymptomatic or pretreated and controlled; measurable or non-measurable) were included. IC tumour assessments, performed at the end of week 4 and every 8 weeks thereafter, were evaluated by blinded independent central review (BICR) using RECIST v1.1. Study endpoints were IC objective response rate (IC ORR), IC duration of response (IC DoR) and IC progression-free survival (IC PFS). Safety was evaluated in the integrated safety population, all pts who received \u22651 dose entrectinib (N=504). Results Full analysis set (FAS) comprised 16 pts with baseline CNS metastases per BICR (measurable or non-measurable), with 5 tumour types (8 NSCLC; 4 thyroid; 2 sarcoma; 1 salivary; 1 breast). Of these 16 pts, 8 had measurable CNS metastases (measurable set) and were evaluable for response. IC outcomes for FAS and measurable set are summarised (Table). IC ORRs were high in the FAS (50.0%) and measurable set (62.5%). IC efficacy was evident regardless of prior brain radiotherapy. In the safety population, neurotoxicity profile was similar in pts with (n=176) and without (n=328) baseline CNS metastases (per investigator), including cognitive disorders (6.3% and 6.4% respectively). Conclusions Entrectinib shows durable IC activity in pts with  NTRK- fp solid tumours and baseline CNS metastases.

Methods Eligible pts had advanced/unresectable or metastatic UC, ECOG PS 0-2, and no prior systemic therapy for advanced disease. Pts from 201 sites in 21 countries were randomized 1:1:1 to P 200 mg Q3W for \u226435 cycles, P for \u226435 cycles + C for \u22646 cycles (investigator\u2019s choice [IC] of gemcitabine + either cisplatin or carboplatin), or IC of C for \u22646 cycles. Randomization was stratified by IC of platinum and PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) (\u226510 vs <10). Dual primary endpoints were PFS by blinded central review and OS. A sequential testing strategy was used, beginning with superiority testing of PFS and OS for P + C vs C in the total population ( P -value threshold of \u22640.0019 for PFS and \u22640.0142 for OS as adjusted for \u03b1 spent at interim analyses to maintain overall \u03b1=2.5% [one-sided] with 0.5% and 2.0% allocated to PFS and OS, respectively), followed by noninferiority and superiority testing of OS for P vs C in pts with CPS\u226510 and total pts only if OS for P + C was statistically superior to C. Results 1010 pts were randomized between Oct 19, 2016 and Jun 29, 2018: 351 to P + C, 307 to P, and 352 to C. As of Apr 29, 2020, median (range) time from randomization to cutoff was 31.7 (22.0-42.3) mo. Baseline characteristics were generally well-balanced across arms. Median PFS for P + C, P, and C for total pts was 8.3 mo, 3.9 mo, and 7.1 mo, respectively; median OS was 17.0 mo, 15.6 mo, and 14.3 mo, respectively. HR (95% CI) for P + C vs C was 0.78 (0.65-0.93,  P  = 0.0033) for PFS and 0.86 (0.72-1.02,  P  = 0.0407) for OS. ORR was 54.7% for P + C, 30.3% for P, and 44.9% for C. Median DOR (range) was 8.5 (2.0+-35.5+) mo, 28.2 (2.1+-36.1+) mo, and 6.2 (1.8+-36.3+) mo, respectively. 35.3%, 41.0%, and 61.1% of total pts in P+C, P, and C arms received subsequent therapy (6.6%, 4.6%, and 48.0% of total pts received anti\u2013PD-[L]1), respectively. Grade 3-5 TRAE rate was 75.1% with P + C, 16.9% with P, and 71.6% with C; discontinuation rate of any drug due to an AE was 30.9%, 15.9%, and 18.1%, respectively. Conclusions PFS and OS benefit upon addition of P to C vs C did not reach statistical significance. Due to statistical design, OS noninferiority/superiority of P vs C was not tested.

DANUBE is a phase 3 study to evaluate D, with or without T (an anti\u2013CTLA-4 agent), as a first-line treatment for metastatic UC (NCT02516241). Methods Eligible pts were \u00b318 years of age with an ECOG PS of 0 or 1 and previously untreated, unresectable, stage IV UC. Pts were randomized 1:1:1 to D (1.5 g IV q4w), D+T (D 1.5 g IV q4w + T 75 mg IV q4w for up to 4 doses, followed by D 1.5 g IV q4w), or CT (gemcitabine + cisplatin or carboplatin) for up to 6 cycles, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Randomization was stratified by cisplatin eligibility, PD-L1 status (high [\u226525% of tumor and/or tumor-associated immune cells staining positive] vs low [<25% of both tumor and immune cells staining positive]), and presence/absence of visceral metastases. Dual primary endpoints compared overall survival (OS) for (1) D vs CT in pts with high PD-L1 expression and (2) D+T vs CT in the ITT population. Minimum follow-up time (from the date the last pt was randomized) was 34 months. Results A total of 1032 pts were randomized. Median OS was not significantly different between D and CT among pts with high PD-L1 expression, nor between D+T and CT in the ITT population (Table). Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3\u20134 occurred in 14%, 28%, and 60% of pts in the D, D+T, and CT arms, with deaths possibly related to treatment in 0.6%, 0.6%, and 0.3% of pts, respectively.

SG is an antibody-drug conjugate composed of a humanized IgG1 kappa anti\u2013Trop-2 monoclonal antibody coupled to SN-38 via a unique hydrolyzable linker. TROPHY-U-01 cohort 1 interim results (n=35) reported a 29% objective response rate (ORR). FDA has granted fast track designation for SG (TRODELVY\u2122) in mUC. Methods TROPHY-U-01 (NCT03547973) is a multicohort, global, open-label, phase 2 study evaluating SG clinical activity (10 mg/kg, days 1 and 8 of 21-day cycles) in patients with unresectable locally advanced or mUC with measurable disease, ECOG PS 0\u20131, and creatinine clearance \u226530 mL/min. Cohort 1 includes patients progressing after PLT and CPI, with unlimited prior lines of therapy. Primary objective was ORR evaluated by RECIST v1.1 via central review; secondary objectives were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), duration of response (DOR), and safety. This cohort had a Simon two-stage design with 90% power to reject the null hypothesis of ORR \u226412%. Results 113 patients (78% male; median age 66 y; 72% ECOG PS 1; Bellmunt score 0 [12%],1 [54%], 2 [27%],3 [6%]; 62% with visceral metastases) received a median of 3 prior therapies. Central review confirmed an ORR of 27% (31/113; 95% CI 19\u201337) with 6 complete responses, 25 partial responses and 25% (95% CI 11.5\u201343.4) ORR in patients with liver metastases. Median DOR was 5.9 mo (95% CI 4.7\u20138.6) and clinical benefit rate was 37% (42/113). Median PFS and OS were 5.4 mo (95 %CI 3.5- 6.9) and 10.5 mo (95 %CI 8.2\u201312.3), respectively. Key grade \u22653 treatment-related adverse events were neutropenia (35%), anemia (14%), febrile neutropenia (10%), and diarrhea (10%). There was no treatment-related grade >2 ocular toxicity, neuropathy or interstitial lung disease. There was 1 treatment-related death (neutropenic sepsis). Conclusions SG demonstrated meaningful efficacy with manageable toxicity. These results confirm interim findings, suggest that SG may be a treatment option for mUC, and support a randomized phase III trial. Clinical trial identification NCT03547973.

Atezo + PBC was well tolerated. Here we present PROs (Arm A vs C) to better evaluate the overall treatment (tx) benefit of adding atezo to PBC. Methods 1213 eligible patients (pts) were randomized to Arm A, B (atezo monotherapy) or C. Atezo or PBO was given 1200 mg IV on day (D) 1 of each 3-wk tx cycle; PBC included gemcitabine 1000 mg/m 2  IV on D1 and 8 + carboplatin AUC 4.5 or cisplatin 70 mg/m 2  IV on D1. EORTC QLQ-C30 was completed q3w during tx, at tx discontinuation and \u2248 q3 mo during survival follow-up. Descriptive analyses of scale scores (range, 0-100) included change from baseline (BL) summaries and time to deterioration (TTD) in all-comers in Arm A (n = 451) and C (n = 400). Results Completion rates were 86% at BL and > 70% until wk 66 in both arms; BL PRO scores were comparable. TTD was similar for most function/quality of life (QOL; Table) and symptom scales. HRs for symptom scales (nausea/vomiting, insomnia, appetite loss, diarrhoea, pain, constipation, fatigue, dyspnoea) ranged from 0.74 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.96; nausea/vomiting) to 1.16 (95% CI: 0.89, 1.51; dyspnoea). 12-mo deterioration-free rates favoured Arm A for nausea/vomiting, appetite loss, role function and social function. Change from BL summaries suggested similar changes (stable or marginal improvement) for both arms in most symptom, function and QOL domains through wk 51 (23% pts eligible for PRO assessments).

We report exploratory biomarker analyses. Methods Tumor biopsies were collected prior to randomization. Tumor analyses included PD-L1 (Ventana SP263 assay) and CD8 immunohistochemistry, whole-exome sequencing (including  FCGR2A  and  FCGR3A  genotypes), whole-transcriptome sequencing, and T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing. Analyses of peripheral blood included baseline C-reactive protein (CRP) level and neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as well as TCR sequencing before and on treatment. Associations between OS or progression-free survival and biomarkers were evaluated using the Cox proportional hazards model. Hazard ratios and nominal p values were reported, and no multiplicity adjustments were made (5% level for statistical significance). Results Increased OS benefit with avelumab 1L maintenance + BSC vs BSC alone was positively associated with CD8 +  T cells in the invasive margin or tumor center, high tumor mutation burden, and tumor gene expression signatures of innate and adaptive immune response. Increased OS benefit was also positively associated with the number of  FCGR2A / FCGR3A  alleles encoding high-affinity Fc\u03b3 receptors for IgG1. OS benefit with avelumab was negatively associated with tumor epithelial cell gene signatures, mutations affecting fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling, CRP, and NLR. In pts with elevated immune gene expression signatures, lower TGFb expression was associated with greater OS benefit with avelumab. Further analyses will be presented, including outcomes by exploratory PD-L1 cutoffs in tumor vs immune cells. Conclusions OS benefits of avelumab 1L maintenance in pts with advanced UC are positively associated with biomarkers of immune activity and negatively associated with biomarkers of tumor homeostasis and chronic inflammation.

IMpassion131 (NCT03125902) evaluated atezo + PAC as first-line treatment for mTNBC. Methods Eligible patients (no prior systemic therapy or \u226512 months since [neo]adjuvant chemotherapy) were randomised 2:1 to atezo 840 mg or placebo (d 1 & 15 q28d), both with PAC 90 mg/m 2 \u00a0(d 1, 8 & 15 q28d) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Stratification factors were tumour PD-L1 status (immune cell [IC] expression <1% vs \u22651% by VENTANA SP142 assay), prior taxane, liver metastases and geographic region. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed PFS, tested hierarchically first in the PD-L1+ (IC \u22651%) population, then in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. OS and overall response rate (ORR) were secondary endpoints. Results Of 651 randomised patients, 45% had PD-L1+ mTNBC, 48% were taxane pretreated, 31% had de novo mTNBC and 27% liver metastases. Adding atezo to PAC did not improve PFS or OS in either the PD-L1+ or ITT populations (Table). PFS results in subgroups were consistent with primary results. PAC exposure was not compromised by the addition of atezo. Grade 5 (2% placebo vs 2% atezo) and grade 3/4 AEs (43% vs 49%) were balanced between arms and the safety profile was consistent with known risks of each study drug.

Here we report prespecified final OS and long-term safety results. Methods The study design and final PFS analysis have been reported (Schmid  NEJM  2018). Pts were randomised 1:1 to A + nP or placebo (P) + nP. Co-primary endpoints were PFS (tested in parallel in ITT and PD-L1+ pts) and OS (tested hierarchically in ITT and, if significant, in PD-L1+ pts). Results As of 14 April 2020, 666/902 pts (73.8%) had died; median OS follow-up was 18.8 mo (IQR, 8.9-34.7 mo). 6% of pts in the A + nP arm and 2% in the P + nP arm remained on any treatment. OS data are in the Table. 460 A + nP arm pts and 430 P + nP arm pts were safety evaluable, of whom 8% and 3%, respectively, received nP for up to 24 mo. Similarly, 5% in the A + nP arm received nP for \u2265 24 mo (vs 1% in the P + nP arm). Respectively, 51% vs 43% had a G 3-4 AE; \u2248 1% per arm had a G 5 AE (no new G 5 AEs since last analysis; no patterns seen); 24% vs 19% had a serious AE, and 59% vs 42% had an AE of special interest (G 3-4 in 8% vs 5%). No confirmed or suspected COVID-19 AEs were reported. 19% in the A + nP arm and 8% in the P + nP arm had an AE leading to treatment discontinuation (most commonly due to neuropathy); in 18% and 8%, respectively, AEs led to nP discontinuation, and in 8% and 1%, AEs led to A or P discontinuation. Conclusions While OS differences for A + nP vs P + nP in the IMpassion130 ITT population were not statistically significant, precluding formal testing, clinically meaningful OS benefit was observed in PD-L1+ pts (7.5-mo median OS improvement). A + nP remained safe and tolerable with longer follow-up. Results from this final and mature OS analysis are consistent with prior interim analyses.

SG (TRODELVY\u2122) is a first-in-class antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of an anti\u2013Trop-2 antibody coupled to the active metabolite of irinotecan, SN-38, via a unique hydrolyzable linker that allows for SN-38 release intracellularly and in the tumor microenvironment (bystander effect). In a phase I/II IMMU-132-01 study, SG demonstrated 33% ORR and an mPFS of 5.5 months (mo) in pts with mTNBC with manageable safety, leading to accelerated US FDA approval of SG. The randomized phase III ASCENT study was initiated to confirm those results. Methods In the ASCENT study (NCT02574455), pts with mTNBC who had relapsed/refractory disease after \u22652 prior chemotherapies in the advanced/metastatic setting (prior taxane required) were randomized 1:1 to receive SG (10 mg/kg IV on d 1, 8 every 21 d) or single-agent TPC (capecitabine, eribulin, vinorelbine, or gemcitabine) until disease progression/unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was PFS measured by central review per RECIST v1.1 in the brain metastases-negative population (BMneg). Key secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS), ORR RECIST v1.1, and safety. Results Of 529 pts enrolled, 468 were BMneg (median age, 54 y; median prior lines, 4). SG (n=235) compared with TPC (n=233) significantly improved mPFS (5.6 vs 1.7 mo; HR, 0.41;  P <0.0001) and median OS (12.1 vs 6.7 mo; HR, 0.48;  P <0.0001). ORR was 35% for SG vs 5% for TPC ( P <0.0001). In the safety population (pts who received \u22651 dose of study drug; n=482), key treatment-related grade \u22653 adverse events with SG (n=258) vs TPC (n=224) were neutropenia (51% vs 33%), diarrhea (10.5% vs <1%), anemia (8% vs 5%), and febrile neutropenia (6% vs 2%). No grade >3 neuropathy or interstitial lung disease, and no treatment-related deaths were reported with SG. Conclusions ASCENT is the first phase III study of an ADC with significant PFS and OS improvement over SOC chemotherapy in pretreated mTNBC, confirming the clinical activity and safety profile of SG monotherapy.

In the phase III SOLAR-1 trial of pts with progression on/after aromatase inhibitor (AI), the PI3K\u03b1 inhibitor ALP together with FUL significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) in the  PIK3CA -mutant (mut) cohort (HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.50-0.85;  P <0.001; median [m] PFS 11.0 mo with ALP + FUL vs 5.7 mo with placebo [PBO] + FUL), a population with poor prognosis. At final PFS analysis, the first interim OS results were immature. Methods Men/postmenopausal women (N=572) with HR+, HER2\u2013 ABC with no prior chemotherapy treatment (tx) and whose disease progressed on/after AI were randomized 1:1 to receive ALP (300 mg PO QD) or PBO, + FUL (500 mg IM on D1 and D15 of C1 then D1 of each 28-d cycle) and stratified by presence of lung and/or liver metastases and prior cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor. OS in the  PIK3CA -mut cohort, a key secondary endpoint, was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier methodology; a 1-sided stratified log-rank test was performed with an O\u2019Brien-Fleming efficacy boundary of  P \u22640.0161. Results With mOS follow-up of 30.8 mo, mOS was 39.3 mo (95% CI 34.1-44.9) with ALP + FUL and 31.4 mo (95% CI 26.8-41.3) with PBO + FUL (HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.64-1.15;  P =0.15); OS did not cross the prespecified boundary. Median time to chemotherapy (TTC) was 23.3 mo (95% CI 15.2-28.4) with ALP + FUL and 14.8 mo (95% CI 10.5-22.6) with PBO + FUL (HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.54-0.95). In pts with lung and/or liver metastases, mOS was 37.2 mo (95% CI 28.7-43.6) with ALP + FUL and 22.8 mo (95% 19.0-26.8) with PBO + FUL (HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.46-1.00). No new safety signals were observed with longer follow-up. Conclusions Though not statistically significant, OS was prolonged by a clinically relevant \u22488 mo with ALP when added to FUL in HR+, HER2\u2212,  PIK3CA -mut ABC. mTTC was also prolonged with ALP + FUL vs PBO + FUL. Coupled with the statistically and clinically significant PFS, these data further support ALP + FUL in this poorer prognostic population of pts with  PIK3CA -mut ABC.

In the phase II nextMONARCH study, primary analysis of PFS and ORR confirmed the robust single-agent activity of abemaciclib in heavily pretreated HR+, HER2- MBC with no significant improvement by addition of tamoxifen. We here report the final 24-month overall survival results. Methods nextMONARCH was a multicenter, randomized, open-label phase II trial of abemaciclib in women with heavily pretreated HR+, HER2- MBC whose disease progressed on or after ET and chemotherapy. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to abemaciclib 150 mg + tamoxifen 20 mg (A+T), or abemaciclib 150 mg (A-150) or abemaciclib 200 mg plus prophylactic loperamide (A-200). Final OS analysis occurred 24 months after the last patient entered treatment. OS was a preplanned secondary endpoint. Results At the time of data cutoff (28-June-2019), 12 of the 234 patients enrolled were still ongoing on study treatment. Median follow-up was 27.2 months. Median OS was 24.2 months in the A+T arm, compared to 20.8 months in A-150, and 17.0 months in A-200 (A+T vs. A-150: HR 0.620 (95% CI [0.397, 0.969] p=0.034); A-150 vs. A-200: HR 0.956 (95% CI [0.635, 1.438] p=0.832)). The primary PFS endpoint and ORR were unchanged at the 24-month analysis. Common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) across all abemaciclib arms occurring in \u226525% of patients included diarrhea (61.1%), neutropenia (49.6%), anemia (40.6%), nausea (36.3%), leukopenia (30.8%), fatigue (29.9%) and abdominal pain (27.4%). Conclusions Addition of tamoxifen to abemaciclib provided a statistically significant median OS improvement compared to abemaciclib monotherapy in this heavily pretreated HR+, HER2- MBC patient population. PFS was consistent with the primary results of nextMONARCH with no significant difference. No new safety findings were observed. Clinical trial identification NCT02747004.

Results from the safety run-in (part 1) and biomarker cohort (part 2) of COMBI-i (NCT02967692) have been previously reported. Part 3 is a global, placebo (PBO)-controlled, double-blind, Phase III study evaluating the anti -PD-1 antibody Sparta + Dab and Tram in pts with previously untreated BRAF V600 -mutant unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Here we report the primary analysis for part 3 of COMBI-i. Methods Pts were randomized 1:1 to receive Sparta 400 mg IV Q4W + Dab 150 mg orally BID + Tram 2 mg orally QD vs PBO-DabTram. The statistical plan ensured 80% power assuming a 5-month tx delay. The primary endpoint is investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) using RECIST 1.1; significance threshold was P < .025 [equivalent HR < 0.801]. Overall survival (OS) is a key secondary endpoint. Results 532 pts were randomized to receive Sparta-DabTram (n = 267) or PBO-DabTram (n = 265). At the data cutoff (July 1, 2020), median follow-up was 27.2 mo. Baseline characteristics were balanced across tx arms. Sparta-DabTram did not significantly improve PFS vs PBO (median PFS, 16.2 mo vs 12.0 mo; HR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.655-1.027]; P = .042). Estimated 12- and 24-mo PFS rates with Sparta-DabTram vs PBO were 58% vs 50% and 44% vs 36%, respectively. While OS was not formally tested, median OS was not reached (NR) across tx arms (HR, 0.785). The objective response rate was 69% in the Sparta-DabTram arm (complete response rate [CRR], 20%) vs 64% in the PBO arm (CRR, 18%); median duration of response was NR vs 20.7 mo, respectively. Tx-related adverse events (TRAEs) grade \u2265 3 occurred in 55% vs 33% of pts treated with Sparta-DabTram vs PBO. TRAEs leading to discontinuation of all 3 study drugs occurred in 12% vs 8% of pts, respectively. Conclusions The primary endpoint was not met. Sparta-DabTram did not significantly improve PFS vs PBO-DabTram; analyses interrogating OS benefit are ongoing. AE management was challenging and resulted in frequent dose adaptations.

The open-label, single-arm, phase 2 LEAP-004 study (NCT03776136) evaluates the combination of len (multikinase inhibitor) and pembro (anti\u2013PD-1) in this population. Methods Eligible pts had unresectable stage III-IV MEL, PD confirmed per iRECIST within 12 wk of the last dose of a PD-1/L1 inhibitor given alone or with anti\u2013CTLA-4 or other therapies for \u22652 doses, measurable disease, and ECOG PS 0/1. Pts received len 20 mg/d PO QD + \u226435 doses of pembro 200 mg IV Q3W until PD or unacceptable toxicity; eligible pts could be treated beyond PD. Imaging is done Q9W through wk 54, Q12W through wk 102, and Q24W thereafter. Primary end point is ORR per RECIST v1.1 by blinded independent central review (BICR). Secondary end points are PFS and DOR per RECIST v1.1 by BICR, OS, and safety. Results From Feb to Sep 2019, 103 pts were enrolled and treated; median age was 63 y, 67.0% had stage M1c/M1d disease, 55.3% had LDH >ULN (20.4% \u22652 \u00d7 ULN), and 36.9% had BRAFV600 mutation. 61.2% received \u22652 prior therapies for MEL, 32.0% received prior BRAF \u00b1 MEK inhibition, and 28.2% had PD on prior anti\u2013PD-1/L1 + anti\u2013CTLA-4. Median study follow-up was 12.0 mo (range 8.7-15.6). Confirmed ORR by BICR was 21.4% (95% CI 13.9-30.5; 2 CRs, 20 PRs) overall and 31.0% (15.3-50.8; 1 CR, 8 PRs) for pts with PD on prior anti\u2013PD-1/L1 + anti\u2013CTLA-4. DCR was 65.0%. Median DOR was 6.3 mo (range 2.1+-11.1+); KM estimate of DOR \u22656 mo was 72.6%. Median (95% CI) PFS and OS were 4.2 mo (3.5-6.3) and 13.9 mo (95% CI 10.8-NR). 9-mo PFS and OS estimates were 26.2% and 65.4%. Most common treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) were hypertension (56.3%), diarrhea (35.9%), and nausea (34.0%). TRAEs were gr 3-5 in 44.7%, gr 5 in 1.0%, and led to discontinuation of len and/or pembro in 7.8%. Conclusions The combination of len and pembro has activity in pts with advanced MEL with confirmed progression on a PD-1/L1 inhibitor, including those with PD on combined anti\u2013PD-1/L1 + anti\u2013CTLA-4. The safety profile was consistent with prior studies. These data support len + pembro as a potential regimen for this population of high unmet need.

TT (encorafenib + binimetinib- E+B) has higher response rates, but these may be limited in duration. Conversely, I-O (ipilimumab + nivolumab \u2013 I+N) may have lower response rates, but more durable responses. Both treatments increase OS in metastatic melanoma patients. The question about which should be the first option is open. One strategy could be a short course of TT, switched to combo IO prior to progression of disease. In order to answer to this question, we conducted the SECOMBIT study, a randomized three-arms phase II study (NCT02631447). Methods From Nov 2016 to May 2019, n.251 patients with untreated, metastatic  BRAFV600  mutated melanoma, were enrolled at 37 centers in 9 countries. They were randomized 1:1:1 to Arm A [E+B until PD, followed by I+N], or Arm B (I+N until PD, followed by E+B) or Arm C (E+B for 8 weeks, followed by I+N until PD, followed by E+B). Patients received the treatments with the following schedules: TT, E 450mg p.o. daily + B 45mg p.o. bid; I-O, I 3mg/kg + N 1mg/kg Q3w x 4 cycles, followed by N 3mg/kg Q2w. Overall survival is the primary endpoint of the study. Secondary endpoints include total PFS, 2- and 3-years survival rate, best overall response rate, duration of response, biomarkers evaluation. Results 69 patients were treated in arm A, 71 in arm B and 69 in arm C. At a median follow-up of 17.5 months (IQR 10.2-23.4\u2013 d.b.lock July 2020), we report preliminary data of PFS, ORR and safety. mPFS was 15.8 months in Arm A, 7.2 months in Arm B, and 11.4 months in Arm C. In the 3 Arms 1-year PFS was 60%, 43% and 46% and 2-year PFS was 35%, 38% and 39% respectively. ORR was 82.6% (CR 21.7%) in Arm A, 45.1% (CR 15.5%) in Arm B and 78.3% (CR 29.0%) in Arm C. G3/4 toxicity was 49% in Arm A, 73% in Arm B and 51% in Arm C, while G.3/4 treatment-related adverse events were 28%, 54% and 32%. 18 pts were discontinued due to adverse events, 7 in Arm A, 8 in Arm B and 3 in Arm C. Conclusions At a minimum follow up of 1 year, our data confirm what reported in the pivotal studies. Despite the difference in term of mPFS, the 2-yrs PFS rate is similar among the different arms. The study is still ongoing for the completion of the main endpoint (OS). Clinical trial identification NCT02631447. Legal entity responsible for the study Fondazione Melanoma Onlus.

At a 1.25-year (yr) median follow-up, pembrolizumab improved recurrence-free survival (RFS) (hazard ratio [HR] 0.57, P<0.0001) as compared to placebo (Eggermont, NEJM 2018). This led to the approval of pembrolizumab adjuvant treatment by EMA and FDA. Methods Eligible pts included those \u226518 yrs of age with complete resection of cutaneous melanoma metastatic to lymph node(s), classified as AJCC-7 stage IIIA (at least one lymph node metastasis >1 mm), IIIB or IIIC (without in-transit metastasis). Between Aug-2015 until Nov-2016, 1019 pts were randomized to pembrolizumab at a flat dose of 200 mg (N=514) or placebo (N=505) every 3 weeks for a total of 18 doses (\u223c1 year) or until disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. The 2 main co-primary endpoints were RFS in the intention-to-treat (ITT) overall population and in pts with PD-L1-positive tumors. Secondary endpoints included distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) in these 2 respective populations. The final DMFS analysis was foreseen when approximately 423 DMFS events (distant metastases or deaths) are reported (\u223c87% power to detect a HR of 0.725 in the overall population). Results By April 2020, 418 DMFS events were reported. At 3.5 yr median follow-up, pembrolizumab compared with placebo significantly prolonged DMFS in the overall population (3.5-yr DMFS rate: 65.3% vs 49.4%; HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.49-0.73; P<0.0001) and in the PD-L1-positive tumor (N=853; HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.49-0.76; P<0.0001). The impact of pembrolizumab on DMFS was similar in pts with a PD-L1-negative tumor (N=116; HR 0.49, 99% CI 0.24-0.99) and in other subgroups, in particular according to AJCC-7 and -8 staging, and BRAF mutation status. The RFS improvement was confirmed (HR in the ITT population 0.59; 95% CI 0.49-0.70). Conclusions At 3.5-yr median follow-up, pembrolizumab adjuvant therapy provided a clinically meaningful improvement in DMFS in resected high-risk stage III melanoma pts.

Updated 48-mo RFS and distant metastases-free survival (DMFS) and primary OS are presented. Methods Pts aged \u2265 15 y with completely resected stage IIIB/C or IV melanoma were stratified by stage and tumor programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) status and randomized 1:1 to NIVO (3 mg/kg Q2W; n = 453) or IPI (10 mg/kg Q3W for 4 doses, Q12W thereafter; n = 453) for \u2264 1 y or until disease recurrence/unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was RFS. Secondary endpoints included OS and safety; DMFS in stage III disease was exploratory. Results At 48 mo of follow-up, NIVO continued to demonstrate superior RFS vs IPI (HR 0.71; 95% CI 0.60\u20130.86;  P  = 0.0003; Table). DMFS in pts with stage III disease favored NIVO (HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.63\u20130.99). At 48 mo, the number of OS events (n = 211) was lower than anticipated (n = 302) and OS rates were comparable: 78% (95% CI 73.7\u201381.5) with NIVO and 77% (95% CI 72.2\u201380.3) with IPI (HR 0.87, 95.03% CI 0.66\u20131.14,  P  = 0.3148). Subsequent systemic next-line therapy was received by 150 (33%) NIVO-treated pts and 189 (42%) IPI-treated pts; more IPI-treated pts (34% vs 23%) received subsequent systemic immunotherapy (IO). Any-grade late-emergent treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs; reported > 100 d after last dose) were observed in 18 (4%) NIVO-treated pts and 25 (6%) IPI-treated pts, with grade 3/4 in 3 (1%) and 7 (2%), respectively. Conclusions NIVO continued to demonstrate improved RFS and DMFS vs IPI at 48 mo in pts with stage III/IV melanoma at high risk of recurrence. OS events (n = 211) were lower than anticipated (n = 302). OS rates were similar to NIVO and IPI, although use of subsequent IO therapy was higher in the IPI arm. Late-emergent TRAEs were consistent with the established safety profile of NIVO and IPI, with more events reported with IPI.

Pts had to face with this unprecedented situation, as caregivers forced\u00a0to suddenly adjust their practices. We assessed the pandemic-induced therapeutic modifications of pts cancer tt and the psychological impact on pts and caregivers. Methods This prospective French study was initiated among pts with solid/hematologic malignancy receiving a medical tt during the lockdown in outpatient departments of 2 cancer centers. Tt modifications were collected from medical records. Perceived and post-traumatic stress (PSS, IES-R), sleep (ISI), quality of life QoL (Fact-G) and cognitive complaint (Fact-Cog) were reported at baseline (during the lockdown) and will be collected at 3 and 6 months. PSS and professional burnout/self-efficacy (MBI, GSES) were also reported by caregivers. Results Baseline clinical data are available for 621 pts and questionnaires for 575 pts (93%) and 73 caregivers. Pts and caregivers median ages were 64 [24-89] and 40 [22-63], 69% and 81% women. Caregivers were mainly nurses (48%) and oncologists (30%). 98% of pts had solid tumors, 59% with metastatic disease and 47% de novo treated. Main tts included chemotherapy (72%), immunotherapy (31%) and targeted therapy (13%), 37% starting during the lockdown. 27% of pts had tt modifications including 30% adapted monitoring (mainly phone-consultation), 15% tt interruptions, 32% postponed tt, 19% administration rhythm modifications, more frequently among lung cancer, tt initiated before lockdown, immunotherapy and targeted therapy. Severe perceived stress, post-traumatic stress and insomnia were observed in 6%, 21% and 24% of pts. More pts with tt modifications presented severe post-traumatic stress (27% vs 19%, p=0.05). Tt modifications did not impact on QoL/cognition. Perceived stress score was higher among caregivers than pts (p=0.035) but 2/3 reported professional accomplishment and self efficacy. Conclusions Lockdown due to COVID-19 induced tt modification in 1/4 of pts with a majored post-traumatic stress. Despite a high level of stress, caregivers coped with the situation.

The ESMO Resilience Task Force collaboration set out to investigate wellbeing in oncology over time since CV-19. Methods 2 online surveys were conducted (survey I April/May; survey II July/August 2020). Statistical analyses were used to examine group differences, associations and to explore predictors of key outcomes: 1) wellbeing/distress (Wellbeing Index (WBI-9)), 2) burnout (1 item); and 3) CV-19 job performance (2 item CJP; standard of care and job delivery compared to pre-CV 19). Results Survey I had 1520 participants from 101 countries. Responses indicate that CV-19 is impacting the oncology workforce resulting in a number of changes to work and personal lives. 25% were at risk of distress (poor wellbeing, WBI \u22654); 38% reported feeling burnout and 66% were not able to perform their job compared to pre-CV-19. Higher CJP was significantly associated with better wellbeing and not feeling burnout (p<0.01). Differences were seen in wellbeing and CJP between countries (p<0.001) and related to CV-19 country mortality rate (p<0.05). The main predictors of wellbeing, burnout and CJP were resilience and changes to work hours. Others frequently identified were coping strategies, ethnicity, concern about training/career, worried about current wellbeing, and working conditions. In Survey II, results from 942 participants are undergoing analysis. Overall, comparisons between surveys show overall wellbeing and burnout rates have worsened overtime but CJP has improved. Among 272 participants who completed both surveys, WBI scores \u22654 (indicating higher risk of distress) and burnout rates were higher in survey II compared to survey I\u00a0(22% vs 31% p=0.01; 35% vs 49% p=0.001 respectively) suggesting wellbeing and burnout may be worsening overtime. CJP improved (38% vs 54% p<0.001). Conclusions In the largest global survey series, COVID-19 is impacting on the wellbeing and job performance of oncology professionals. Risk of distress and burnout has increased over time. Urgent measures to address wellbeing and improve resilience are essential. Legal entity responsible for the study ESMO. Funding ESMO.

Small studies have suggested inferior outcomes in patients (pts) on active cancer treatment. This finding was not independently validated in our prior report on 928 pts, which included treatments administered within 4 weeks of COVID-19 diagnosis. Here, we examine outcomes related to systemic cancer treatment within one year of lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in an expanded cohort. Methods The COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) registry (NCT04354701) was queried for pts ever receiving systemic treatment. Treatment type, cancer type, stage, and COVID-19 outcomes were examined. Pts were stratified by time from last treatment administration: <2 wk, 2-4 wk, 1-3 mo, or 3-12 mo. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) of mortality by treatment type and timing were calculated. Results As of 31 July 2020, we analyzed 3920 pts; 42% received systemic anti-cancer treatment within 12 mo (Table). 159 distinct medications were administered. The highest rate of COVID-19-associated complications were observed in pts treated within 1-3 months prior to COVID-19; all-cause mortality in this group was 26%. 30-day mortality by most recent treatment type was 20% for chemotherapy, 18% for immunotherapy, 17% for chemoradiotherapy, 29% for chemoimmunotherapy, 20% for targeted therapy, and 11% for endocrine therapy. SIR of mortality was highest for chemoimmunotherapy or chemotherapy <2 wks, and lowest for endocrine treatments. A high SIR was also found for targeted agents within 3-12 mo. Pts untreated in the year prior to COVID-19 diagnosis had a mortality of 14%.

Conclusions 30-day mortality was highest amongst cancer pts treated 1-3 months prior to COVID-19 diagnosis and those treated with chemoimmunotherapy. Except for endocrine therapy, mortality for subgroups was numerically higher than in pts untreated within a year prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. Clinical trial identification NCT04354701.

A lack of prospective data regarding cancer patients with COVID-19 hampers the development of an evidence based approach in this population. The Clinical Characterisation Protocol-CANCER-UK is a UK multi-disciplinary project aimed at characterising the presentation and course of COVID-19 in cancer patients with the aim of informing practice. Methods The international Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium (ISARIC)-4C COVID-19 Clinical Information Network (CO-CIN) collects data on hospital inpatients with proven/high likelihood of COVID-19. Data was collected in 166 UK sites using a questionnaire adopted by the WHO. Data on patients with malignant neoplasm was extracted from the main dataset. We chose a priori to restrict any analysis of outcome to patients who were admitted more than 14 days before data extraction (13th May 2020). Results As of 13th May 2020 1797 of 16160 participants had malignant neoplasm (8.6% of all cases). Age<50 62 (3.5%), 50-60 378 (21%), 70-79 558 (31%), 80+ 1002 (42%). Male 1147 (64%); Female 645 (36%). Commonest comorbidities chromic pulmonary disease (22%), chronic kidney disease (21%), uncomplicated diabetes (19%) and dementia (14%). Outcomes 35% discharged alive, 30% care ongoing & 35% died. Admiited to ICU: 150 cases (25% discharged alive,31% care ongoing & 45% died). Receiving invasive ventiation: 67 cases (18% discharged alive, 25% care ongoing:25% & 57% died). HR mortality for malignancy (adjusted for age, sex, other comorbidity): 1.13 (1.02-1.24, p=0.017). Data on presentation will be presented. Conclusions Europe\u2019s largest prospective COVID-19 dataset demonstrates that cancer is independently associated with mortality in patients admitted with COVID-19. Data collection is on-going and updated data will be presented including a comparison of cancer vs. non-cancer cohort with regard to presentation, comorbidity and otucomes.

In addition, systematic pan-tumor analyses may reveal the relative importance of tumour cell intrinsic and microenvironmental features underpinning CPI sensitization. Methods Here we collated raw whole exome sequencing and transcriptomic data on >1000 patients treated with checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) treatment across eight tumor types (CPI1000+ cohort), utilizing a uniform bioinformatics pipeline. In addition harmonized RECIST response measures were collected from each study to allow standardized clinical outcome analysis. A systematic literature search was conducted to identify previously published biomarkers, which were then tested across the >1000 patient cohort via meta-analysis. Finally, single cell sequencing of tetramer positive T cells from patient tumour tissue was conducted to further validate results. Results Clonal-TMB was the strongest predictor of CPI response, followed by TMB and  CXCL9  expression. Subclonal-TMB, somatic copy alteration burden and HLA-evolutionary divergence failed to attain significance. Mutation signature analysis revealed apobec, UV and tobacco associated mutations predictive of CPI response even after correction for TMB. scRNA sequencing of clonal neoantigen-reactive CD8-TILs, combined with bulk RNAseq analysis of CPI responding tumors, identified  CCR5  and  CXCL13  as T cell-intrinsic mediators of CPI-sensitisation. Finally, combination of biomarkers together into a multi-variate predictive algorithm was shown to attain siginificantly higher AUC scores than TMB alone, in both validation (n=406) and independent test set (n=383). Conclusions We find that high clonal mutation burden, apobec/UV/tobacco mutation signatures, together with elevated  CXCL9  and  CXCL13  expression, as core features marking a tumor as likely to respond to CPI therapy. As biomarker datasets continue to grow in size there is tangible opportunity to build a more complete understanding of CPI response, and identify molecularly defined patient cohorts with high chance of response.

Thus, we integrated blood descriptors of pro-inflammatory/immunosuppressive or effective anti-tumor response to define predictive immune profiles in ICI-treated advanced NSCLC. Methods Peripheral blood (PB) was prospectively collected at baseline from 109 consecutive NSCLC patients undergoing ICI as first or more line treatment. Soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) (immunoassay), CD8+PD1+ and NK cells (FACS) were assessed and integrated to generate an Immune effector Score (I eff S). Lung Immune Prognostic Index (LIPI) was also computed by LDH levels and derived Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (dNLR). All these parameters were correlated with survival outcome and response to treatment. Results High sPD-L1 and low PB number of CD8+PD1+ and NK cells, individually had a negative impact on both PFS (P<0.001) and OS (P<0.01) as well as on ICI-response (P<0.05). Thus, sPD-L1 high , CD8+PD1+ low  and NK low  were considered as risk factors encompassing I eff S, whose prognostic power outperformed that of single features and slightly exceeded that of LIPI. Accordingly, the absence of these pre-determined risk factors portrayed a favorable I eff S able to identify NSCLC patients with significantly prolonged PFS (median NR vs 2.3 months, P<0.001) and OS (median NR vs 4.1, P<0.001) and greater benefit from ICI (P<0.01). We then combined each individual risk parameter composing I eff S and LIPI (LDH high , dNLR high ), thus defining three distinct prognostic classes: 0-1 vs 2-3 vs \u2265 4 risk factors. A remarkable impact of I eff S-LIPI integration was documented in terms of survival outcome (PFS: HR, 4.61; 95% CI, 2.32-9.18; P<0.001; OS: HR, 4.03; 95% CI, 1.91-8.67; P<0.001) and response to ICI (ROC curve AUC=0.90, 95% CI 0.81-0.97, P<0.001). Conclusions Composite risk models based on blood parameters featuring the tumor-host interaction might provide non-invasive prognostic and predictive scores in ICI-treated advanced NSCLC patients.

However, genomic alterations (GAs) detected are still not routinely used for therapeutic decision in the majority of the tumor types. The ESMO ESCAT ranks the GAs based on their clinical actionability. Since 2018, our Molecular Tumor Board (MTB) stratified the GAs detected in tissue/liquid biopsy based on ESCAT to guide treatment selection. Based on ESCAT, we aimed to assess clinical actionability of GAs through our MTB. Methods Patients (pts) with metastatic solid tumors enrolled in MOSCATO (NCT01566019) and MATCHR (NCT02517892) trials underwent a tumor biopsy at time of relapse. Molecular profiling was performed using next-generation sequencing (NGS), whole-exome sequencing and RNA-sequencing. Clinical actionability of GAs was prospectively assessed at our MTB according to ESCAT tiers. Clinical characteristics and outcome of pts were also collected. Results Between Nov 2018 and March 2020, 387 pts underwent a biopsy. Molecular data from 366 pts were interpreted at the MTB. Median age was 61 (range, 24-90); 221 pts (60%) were male. Twenty-seven different tumor types were discussed; the most common were lung (n=117, 32%), gastrointestinal (n=105, 28%) and urological cancer (n=60; 16%). At least one GA was detected in 94% (366/388; 5% failed analysis). Based on ESCAT, GAs were classified according to the tumor type: 20% were tier I [N=72: 25  EGFR  mutation (m), 6  ALK  rearrangement (r); 6  FGFRr , 4  BRAFV600E m; 9  RETr , 9  RET m; 5 MSI-H; 3  ROS1 r; 2  HER2 a; 2  BRCA m; 1  MET m]; 7% as tier II (n=25: 19  KRASG12C m; 3  BRAFV600E m [other than lung/melanoma]; 2  MET a; 2 HERm); 19% as tier III (n=48) and 16% as tier IV (n=59). Based on ESCAT, CGP reported clinically informative results in 117 pts (32%) and guiding treatment selection in 73 pts (20%). Clinical outcomes (progression free survival; response rate) by ESCAT tier will be presented during the meeting. Conclusions ESCAT classification of genomic alterations is attainable in clinical practice through MTB and helps adjusting treatment on both standard of care or investigational settings. Since ESCAT tiers update regularly, a dynamic review of therapeutic choices is advised. Legal entity responsible for the study Gustave Roussy. Funding Gustave Roussy. Disclosure P.

However, in metastatic cancer, the extent to which somatic genomic profiles are preserved between lesions (heterogeneity in space) and over the course of a patient\u2019s anticancer treatment (heterogeneity in time) remains unclear. Clinicians need guidance on the necessity to repeat genomic characterization in patients with cancer in order to efficiently maximize treatment opportunities. Methods WGS data was prospectively collected of 497 longitudinally sampled biopsies from 239 metastatic cancer patients with tumours from 21 different primary sites. Biopsies were taken prior to and after various types of systemic treatments. Available clinical data was used to study associations between the evolution of somatic genomic profiles and clinical characteristics. Results During the biopsy interval (median 6.4 months, IQR 3.8-9.6 months), there was a statistically significant but modest (median <10%; mean <20%) increase in the number of mutations, copy number alterations, structural variants and indels. Genomic biomarkers for standard-of-care treatments and clinical trial enrolment could be identified in 22% (n=107) and 51% (n=253) of biopsies, respectively. For 99% (n = 247) of the sequential pairs, the second biopsy did not yield new information regarding standard-of-care genomic treatment indications. Out of 355 biomarkers for clinical trial enrolment identified in the first biopsies, 326 (92%) were also present in the subsequent biopsy. For 224 out of 250 (90%) paired biopsies, the second biopsy did not yield additional biomarkers for clinical trial enrolment. Twenty-eight of the 81 (35%) patients treated with targeted or hormonal therapy between the biopsies gained somatic variants within the gene directly targeted by the drug, revealing known and novel resistance mechanisms. Conclusions Our data demonstrates that a one-time WGS analysis during the disease course of a patient with metastatic cancer is (i) sufficient for identifying standard-of-care genomic biomarkers, and (ii) supportive of revealing investigational therapeutic targets that remain present at later stages of the disease.

In the WIDE study (WGS Implementation in standard cancer Diagnostics for Every cancer patient), cWGS is performed on a prospective cohort of 1,200 patients (stage IV solid tumors). Here we report the results on feasibility and clinical validity (primary endpoints) of the first 600 patients. Methods cWGS was conducted independently of, but in parallel with, validated Standard-of-Care (SOC) diagnostics. For 47% of patients, this included SOC molecular diagnostics (MolDx). cWGS and MolDx results were compared and discussed in a dedicated tumor board. Initial discordances were further evaluated by additional tests. Results cWGS was successfully performed in 69% (414/602) of patients with a technical success rate of 96% (414/433). Ineligibility for cWGS was mostly caused by an insufficient number of tumor cells (<20%) in the received biopsy (86%, 145/169). MolDx was performed in 47% (283/602) and was successful in 95% (267/283) of patients. cWGS showed a median turn-around-time (TAT) of 14 days, which decreased incrementally by continuous improvements to the clinical procedure and cWGS pipeline. In total, 480 genomic biomarkers for clinical validation were identified by SOC MolDx. cWGS showed an error rate of 4.2% (20/480) compared to a SOC MolDx error rate of 1% (5/480). Most of the biomarkers that were not reported by cWGS (19 of 20) were present in the raw data but not reliably identified due to very low variant allele frequencies. Improvements to further increase the sensitivity are currently being implemented with an anticipated reduction of the cWGS error rate to 2%. Overall, cWGS identified a clinically actionable (routine practice and experimental) biomarker in 74% of all patients tested. Compared to SOC MolDx, cWGS identified one or more additional treatment options in 69% (197/287) of patients. Interestingly, in patients that were not tested by SOC MolDx, actionable variants were identified in 60% (76/126). Conclusions Based on the first 600 patients of the WIDE study, cWGS was found to be clinically feasible in routine molecular diagnostics in a comprehensive cancer center setting and has added value by providing additional treatment options for the majority of patients.

Methods Pts with confirmed MSI-H/dMMR mCRC with no prior systemic therapy for mCRC were randomized 1:1 to pembro 200 mg Q3W for up to 2 y or investigator\u2019s SOC choice of mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI Q2W \u00b1 bevacizumab or cetuximab. EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-CR29, and EQ-5D-3L were administered at baseline and at various time points up to 1 y or end of treatment, whichever came first, and at 30 days after treatment discontinuation. Data from pts receiving \u22651 dose of study treatment and completing \u22651 HRQoL assessment were analyzed. Least-squares mean (LSM) score change from baseline to prespecified wk 18, 95% CI, and nominal 2-sided  P  values were calculated. Time to deterioration (TTD; \u226510-point decline from baseline) was assessed by Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model. HRs, 95% CIs, and nominal 1-sided  P  values are provided. Results Data for 294 pts (152, pembro; 142 SOC) were available for HRQoL analyses. Compliance at baseline was >90% in pembro and SOC arms for all 3 questionnaires and remained high at wk 18 (>85% and >75%, respectively). LSM change from baseline to wk 18 showed clinically meaningful improvement in QLQ-C30 global health status (GHS)/QoL (LSM difference: 8.96; 95% CI, 4.24-13.69;  P =0.0002) and EQ-5D VAS (LSM difference: 7.38; 95% CI, 2.82-11.93;  P =0.0016) for pts receiving pembro vs SOC. Prolonged TTD for pts receiving pembro vs SOC was observed for GHS/QoL (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38-0.98;  P =0.0195), physical functioning (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.32-0.81;  P =0.0016), social functioning (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.32-0.87;  P =0.0050), and fatigue (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.33-0.69;  P \u22640.0001).

Given the role of cetuximab in enhancing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and promoting expression of MHC class II molecules on dendritic cells, its association with anti-PD-L1 avelumab may be a relevant rechallenge strategy in RAS WT mCRC. Methods CAVE mCRC, a single arm multi-centre phase II study, aims to evaluate the efficacy of avelumab and cetuximab in RAS WT mCRC pts treated in first line with chemotherapy (CT) in combination with anti-EGFR drugs and who achieved a complete (CR) or partial response (PR). Primary endpoint is median overall survival (mOS), secondary endpoints are overall response rate (ORR) according to RECIST 1.1, progression free survival (PFS) and safety profile. This study seeks to demonstrate a mOS of 11 months (mo) for the experimental combination in comparison with historical mOS of 8.0 mo with standard third line treatments, which corresponds to an improvement in mOS of 37,5 %. Results From August 10, 2018 to February 21, 2020, 77 pts have been enrolled and started treatment with avelumab 10 mg/kg q14 and cetuximab at 400 mg/m 2  and subsequently 250 mg/m 2  weekly until progression of disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity. Kaplan-Meier curves estimated for the whole intention-to-treat (ITT) population (77 pts): mOS was 13.1 mo (95% Confidence Interval CI, 7.4-18.8 mo; 32 events); mPFS, 3.6 mo (95% CI, 3.3-3.9 mo; 62 events). Among 65 pts evaluable for response, 1 pt (1.5%) experienced CR, 3 pts (4.6%) PR, 32 pts stable disease (SD) (49.2%); 29 pts PD (44.6%). Pts with PFS\u2265 6 mo were 12/65 (18.5%). Grade-3 adverse events were reported in 16/77 pts (22%), the most common being skin rash 10/77 (13%) and diarrhoea 3/77 (4%). Conclusions At this preliminary analysis, avelumab plus cetuximab as a rechallenge strategy is effective and well tolerated in chemorefractory RAS/BRAF WT mCRC pts. The final analysis for OS will be presented at the ESMO 2020 congress. Clinical trial identification EudraCT 2017-004392-32.

These recommendations are mainly based on expert opinions and results of the few clinical trials performed are controversial. Moreover, no survival benefit has been demonstrated. Methods PRODIGE 13 1  is a prospective multicentre controlled trial evaluating by double randomisation the impact of i) intensive radiological monitoring (CT-scan/6m) versus a standard one (abdominal ultrasound/3m and thoracic radiography/6m) and ii) CEA assessment versus no, in the follow-up of resected stage II or III CRC with no evidence of residual disease on post-surgical investigation in France and Belgium. The primary endpoint was 5-year overall survival (OS). Results Between 09/2009 and 04/2015, 1995 pts were included (75.9%< 75 years old, 16% rectal, 44% left colon cancer (CC)). Among CC 52 % were Stage II (25% received adjuvant chemotherapy). With a median follow-up of 6.5 years, cancer recurrence was detected in 22% of the cases and second CRC in 1.7%. Among recurrences in CC, 8.4% were localized, 74.7% metastatic, and 15.7% both. These pts were treated with curative intent, respectively in 86.7%, 52.3% & 44.6%. Surgical treatment of recurrence with curative intent was 40.9% in the minimum follow-up group (No CEA & standard imaging), 66.3% in the CEA & standard imaging group, 50.7% in the No CEA & CT, and 59.5% in the maximum follow-up group (CEA & CT) (p=0.0035). Among recurrences in rectal cancer, 19.3% were localized, 65% metastatic, and 15.7% both. These pts were treated with curative intent, respectively in 50%, 53.7% & 38.5%. Surgical treatment of recurrence with curative intent was 42.9% in the minimum follow-up group, 57.9% in the CEA group & standard imaging, 55% in the No CEA & CT, and 47.8% in the maximum follow-up group (NS). None of the follow-up modalities resulted in a difference in OS (2 nd  interim analysis - 455 events). Conclusions After curative surgery, the addition of CEA and/or CT does not provide any benefit in 5-year OS, but allows more curative intent secondary surgeries for patients with a more intensive follow-up.

Methods We have assessed the impact of age (categorized as < or \u2265 70 years) on relapse free interval (RFI), defined as time from random to relapse or last disease assessment, in stage III CC pts randomized to receive 3 or 6 months of FOLFOX (FULV plus oxaliplatin) or CAPOX (capecitabine plus oxaliplatin) in the Italian, multicenter, phase III, TOSCA study (clinicaltrials.gov NCT0064660). Results 3,759 pts were enrolled from 130 sites. Overall, 2,360 of them had stage III disease, including 1,667 aged under 70 and 693 aged 70 or over. The elderly had an ECOG performance status (PS) more often equal to 1 (10.5% vs 3.3%, p <0.001), fewer women (40.8% vs 45.1, p=0.057), more T3/T4 tumors (90.9% vs 84.3%, p<0.001), a greater number of poorly differentiated (G3) tumors (28.3% vs 24.2%, p=0.039) and located on the right (40.9% vs 26.6%, p <0.001). No variation for type and treatment arm (p=0.965) was observed. The median follow-up was 62.5 and 60.6 months for the under 70 and the over 70, respectively. In pts over 70, we found a greater proportion of dose reductions (46.7% vs 41.4%, p=0.018), treatment interruptions (26.1% vs 19.3%, p<0.001) and a higher proportion of recurrences (24.2% vs 20.3%, p=0.033). The multivariable analysis of the RFI, corrected for sex, ECOG PS, tumor site, stage, grade, treatment, treatment duration and dose reduction, does not indicate a statistically significant effect of age (HR 1.19, 95% CI 0.98-1.44, p=0.082), although the point estimate is not negligible. Only a stage III high risk CC had a significant impact on RFI (HR [vs low risk] 2.05, 95% CI 1.71-2.46, p<0.001). Conclusions Comparing to younger pts, in elderly stage III CC pts treated with an oxaliplatin-based adjuvant therapy, a different treatment tolerability and a potential reduction of benefit was highlighted. Considerations should be made about the patient's general health status, his comorbidities and the management of the expected side effects. Legal entity responsible for the study GISCAD.

Methods In this phase II randomized trial, patients with non operated stage III-IVa-b SCC of oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx and larynx and unfit for receiving high dose of cisplatin were enrolled. Patients received once-daily IMRT up to 69,96 Gy concomitant with cetuximab (Cetux-RT arm: 400 mg/m 2  loading dose and 250 mg/m 2  weekly) or pembrolizumab (Pembro-RT arm: 200 mg Q3W during RT). The primary endpoint was 15-month Loco-Regional Control (LRC) rate and secondary endpoints included Progression-free survival (PFS), Overall Survival (OS) and tolerance. To detect a difference between arms of 60% to 80% in 15-month LRC, inclusion of 66 patients per arm was required to achieve a power of at least 0.85 at 2-sided significance level of 0.20. Results Between May 2016 and October 2017, 131 patients were randomized and treated by 27 centers: 65 patients in Cetux-RT arm and 66 patients in Pembro-RT arm. The median age was 65 years, 92% were smokers, 60% of oropharynx (46% p16+), 41% of N2c-N3 with 25%, 56% and 19% of stage III, IVa and IVb respectively. Median follow-up was 25 months in both arms. Acute toxicity was lower in Pembro-RT arm than Cetux-RT arm: 74%  vs  92% patients with at least one grade \u2265 3 acute adverse events (p=0.006), mainly due to dermatitis in radiation field, mucositis and cutaneous rash. LRC at 15 months were 59% in Cetux-RT arm and 60% in Pembro-RT arm, not significantly different: OR=1.05 (95%CI: 0.43-2.59, p=0.91). 2-year PFS rate was 40% in the Cetux-RT arm  vs  42% in the Pembro-RT arm. There was no significant difference between arms for PFS: HR=0.83 (95%CI 0.53-1.29, p=0.41). 2-year OS rate was 55% in the Cetux-RT arm  vs  62% in the Pembro-RT arm. OS was not significantly different between arms: HR=0.83 (95%CI: 0.49-1.40, p=0.49). Conclusions Compared to the SOC cetuximab-RT, the anti-PD1 pembrolizumab concomitant with RT did not improve carcinologic outcomes but appeared less toxic. Clinical trial identification NCT 02707588.

This trial investigated whether avelumab, a human anti\u2013PD-L1 antibody, improved progression-free survival (PFS) when combined with concurrent CRT followed by avelumab maintenance. Methods This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial (JAVELIN Head and Neck 100; NCT02952586) included patients with histologically confirmed, previously untreated LA SCCHN of the oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, or oral cavity eligible for definitive CRT with curative intent. Patients were required to have stage III, IVa, or IVb disease per AJCC (7th edition) except for HPV+ oropharyngeal patients, for whom only T4 or N2c or N3 status was allowed. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive avelumab 10 mg/kg IV Q2W + CRT (cisplatin 100 mg/m 2  Q3W + standard fractionation of 70 Gy in 35 fractions over 7 weeks) or placebo + CRT. This was preceded by a lead-in dose and followed by avelumab or placebo maintenance therapy for up to 1 year. The primary endpoint was PFS by investigator assessment per modified RECIST v1.1; interim analysis was planned at \u2248 217 events. Results 697 patients were randomized (avelumab arm, n=350; placebo arm, n=347); baseline characteristics were similar in both arms. At interim analysis, the hazard ratios for PFS per modified RECIST v1.1 (based on 224 events) and overall survival (OS; based on 131 deaths) were 1.21 (95% CI: 0.93-1.57; p=0.920) and 1.31 (95% CI: 0.93-1.85; p=0.937), respectively, both in favor of placebo + CRT. Median PFS and OS were not reached in either arm. Grade \u22653 adverse events (AEs) were more frequent with avelumab + CRT vs placebo + CRT (88% vs 82%); fatal AEs occurred in 6% and 5%, respectively. Rates of AEs leading to discontinuation of any study drug were similar in both arms (33% vs 32% in the avelumab vs placebo arms). Conclusions Tolerability was similar in both arms; however, the study did not demonstrate statistically significant improvement in PFS with avelumab + CRT vs placebo + CRT.

Previously reported data showed significant improvements of xevinapant (Debio 1143) versus placebo in addition to chemoradiation (CRT) for the primary endpoint of locoregional control (LRC) rate at 18 months, and demonstrated that addition of Debio 1143 was feasible, safe and did not compromise backbone therapy. Here we report up-dated data on PFS and overall survival (OS). Methods Patients, stratified by node involvement, tumor localization and HPV-16 status, were randomized (1:1) to receive Debio 1143 or matching placebo at 200 mg/day, oral once daily D1\u201314 q3w (3 cycles) when added to standard high-dose cisplatin CRT. PFS and OS were analyzed using a Cox model in the intention-to-treat population. Median and survival rates at 36 months were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Results As of 21 Jul 2020, the median follow-up was 33 months. Debio 1143 combined with CRT showed a statistically significant improvement in OS vs placebo by reducing the risk of mortality by 51% (HR=0.49, [95%CI: 0.26-0.92], P=0.0261). The 3 years OS rate was 66% (95% CI: 49\u201378) in the Debio 1143 arm versus 51% (95% CI: 34\u201365) in the placebo arm; the median OS is not reached with Debio 1143 vs. 36.1 months with placebo (95%CI: 21.8-46.7). Statistically significant improvement in PFS was demonstrated, reducing the risk of disease progression or death by 66% (HR=0.34 [95%CI, 0.17-0.68], p=0.0023) and improving probability of PFS at 36 months to 72% in the Debio 1143 arm compared to 36% in the placebo arm. The predictable and manageable safety profile observed with Debio 1143 + CRT after 2 years remained unchanged after 3 years. Conclusions These results with extended follow-up confirm those previously reported, showing now in addition a statistically and clinically significant OS benefit by adding Debio 1143 to standard CRT.

We completed a phase Ib/II study with neoadjuvant NIVO or COMBO in resectable head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and show safety, efficacy and correlative biomarker results. Methods 32 stage II-IVB HNSCC patients indicated for curative (salvage) surgery were treated with NIVO (240mg, weeks 1&3, N=6) or NIVO (240mg, weeks 1&3) + IPI (1mg/kg, week 1, N=26) prior to surgery in week 5. Imaging was performed at baseline and week 4. AEs were reported in terms of CTCAE. Pathological response (pR) was defined as % change in viable tumor cells from baseline to on-treatment; \u226590% pR was considered (near-) complete response (pCR). WES and RNAseq were performed on paired tumor biopsies. Results 32 (31 HPV-negative) patients started treatment (stage II n=3, III n=8, IVA-B n=11, recurrent disease n=10). 6 patients included with recurrent disease had had previous (C)RT. 1 patient discontinued ICB after one course due to patient\u2019s preference. Surgery was not postponed in any patient. 3/32 patients did not undergo surgery: 1 due to unresectable PD and 2 due to reasons unrelated to ICB or disease. Grade 3-4 irAEs in 11/32 patients were well manageable. (Near-)pCR in the primary tumor was seen in 9/29 evaluable patients (31%). Another 31% of patients had 20-89% pR. At 14 months median FU, RFS for patients with (near-)pCR was 100%, significantly better than patients with <90% pR (p=<0.05). Metabolic response assessment with FDG-PET (week 4) was able to identify (near-)pCRs. A baseline AID/APOBEC-associated tumor mutational profile was correlated with (near)pCR (p=<0.05). Finally, (near)pCR tumors were characterized by a decrease in hypoxia gene expression after ICB. Conclusions Neoadjuvant ICB was feasible in HNSCC and induced (near)pCR in 31% of evaluable patients at time of surgery, which was accompanied by 100% RFS. Baseline AID/APOBEC-related mutations, on-treatment FDG-PET and resolution of hypoxia need future validation to discover their potential role as biomarkers for (near)pCR after ICB in HNSCC.

A subset of p16+ OPC are HPV-; and their prognosis is still unclear. The aim of this study is to clearly define the proportion, determinants and prognosis of OPC patients who are p16+/HPV-. Methods We established an international consortium comprising 13 cohorts of OPC patients with data on p16, HPV, demographics, tobacco/alcohol use and clinical data. A centralized individual patient data reanalysis was performed. Multivariate models were used to evaluate factors associated with HPV status as defined by different HPV-assessment methods. Proportional-hazards models were used to compare the risk of death (OS) among HPV-related and un-related OPC. Results In total 7702 patients from 9 different countries were included. The percentage of positive cases was 49.7%, 47.9% and 44.3% for p16+, HPV+ and p16+/HPV+, respectively. Among p16+ cases, 10.9% were HPV-. This proportion differed significantly by cohorts and geographic areas (p-value<0.001) and was lowest in the highest prevalence areas (Table). Compared to p16-/HPV- tumors, p16+/HPV+was the biomarker with strongest prognostic value (aHR 0.28, 95%CI 0.25-0.31), followed by p16+/HPV- (aHR=0.65, 95%CI 0.56-0.76), and p16-/HPV+ (HR=0.72, 95%CI 0.60-0.86).

This multicenter trial assesses the feasibility of neoadjuvant durvalumab. Methods Pts IB>4cm\u2013IIIA, non N2 resectable NSCLC (TNM 8 th  edition) receive 3 courses of durvalumab 750 mg (days 1, 15, 29) then underwent resection, between day 2 and 14 after last infusion. Primary endpoint was % of complete surgical resection (R0); secondary endpoints safety, overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), time between first infusion and surgery, response rate (RECIST 1.1), major pathological response (MPR). Results 50 pts included between April 2017 and August 2019. 46 eligible. 67.4% males, median age, 61 y; all ECOG PS 0-1; 98% smokers; 23 adenocarcinoma, 19 squamous; clinical stages IB/IIA/IIB/IIIA n = 5/13/27/1. Among the 46 operated pts, 9 had pneumonectomy, 31 lobectomy, 3 bilobectomy, and 3 an exploratory thoracotomy (2 pleural carcinosis; 1 esophageal invasion). Study was stopped because of an excess in 90-day postoperative mortality (4 deaths, 9%, 1 unknown (died at home); 2 acute respiratory failures; 1 tracheal fistula). 3 out of 4 deceased pts had cardiovascular comorbidities (3 arterial hypertensions; 1 peripheral arterial disease; 1 ischemic heart disease), or other (1 severe COPD; 1 diabetes). 41 pts were R0 (90%). There was no Grade 3-5 durvalumab related AEs. 4/46 pts had PR, 36 SD and 6 PD. Median time between first infusion and surgery was 37 (range: 29-46). Median OS and DFS was not reached; 18-m OS: 88.7% [95% CI: 74.9-95.1] 18-m RFS: 69.7% [95% CI: 53.2-81.3]. Conclusions Enrollment was stopped because of excessive 90-day postoperative mortality. Deaths were due to postoperative complications possibly related to comorbidities and not to direct durvalumab toxicity. MPR rates and ongoing correlative analyses will be presented.

We report the results of a phase 2 trial of neoadjuvant A for NSCLC. Methods Patient (pts) with clinical stage IA (\u2265 2 cm)-IIIA non N2 NSCLC eligible for surgery, PS 0-1, received 1 injection of A (1200 mg IV D1) followed by surgery between D21-D28. The primary endpoint was the rate of pts without major toxicities or morbidities from D1 until 1 month after the surgery. Fresh tumour tissue was analysed within 4 hours after surgery. Response by RECIST1.1 and major pathological response (MPR; \u226410% viable tumour) were assessed. Results From December 2016 to February 2020, 30 pts were enrolled in two centres. The mean age of pts was 64, 50% were female, 7% never smokers, 83% had adenocarcinomas. Pathological stages were I (n=15, 50%), II (n=6, 20%) III (n=9, 30%). All pts had their planned surgery, none were delayed by >15 days. 29 had R0 resection, 1 had R1. Three pts experienced surgical complications: 1 respiratory distress grade 3 with sepsis grade 4, 1 heart block atrioventricular and 1 paresthesia grade 1. There was no grade 5 toxicity. Treatment-related adverse effects (TRAEs) included only one grade 1 parietal pain related to surgery. No RECIST radiological response and no MPR were observed. After A, 15/29 tumours were PD-L1 TC3 or IC3 based on the SP142 assay. 17/30 (56%) tumours had necrosis (med. 5% of tumour surface, 0-80). 20/29 cases had histopathological features of response according to the immune-related pathologic response criteria (irPRC), with isolated or combined features of immune activation (19/20), tissue repair (15/20) and/or tumour cell death (9/20).NGS (11 genes) was performed in 23 tumours resulting in 14  TP53  mutations (mut), 7  KRAS  mutations , 3  EGFR  mutations, 1 wild-type, 1  STK11  mutations (in a tumour with 80% necrosis). Conclusions Surgery after one infusion of A was safe. The short delay between A and surgery might explain the absence of MPR. Clinical trial identification NCT02994576.

Methods STIMULI is a 1:1 randomized phase II international trial aiming to demonstrate superiority of consolidation immunotherapy treatment (C) vs observation (O) after standard CRT and PCI, in patients (pts) with LS-SCLC. C consisted of four cycles of nivolumab (1 mg/kg, Q3W) plus ipilimumab (3 mg/kg, Q3W), followed by nivolumab monotherapy (240 mg, Q2W) for up to 12 months (m). The trial was designed to test two co-primary endpoints, progression-free survival (PFS) by RECIST 1.1 criteria, and overall survival (OS), at 1-sided alpha of 1% and 4%, respectively. Trial enrollment closed prematurely due to slow accrual, after half the initial sample size. The statistical analyses plan was updated to address PFS as primary endpoint to be tested at the full 5% 1-sided significance level. 81 PFS events were needed to achieve a power of 80% for testing an HR of 0.57. Secondary endpoints include OS, time to treatment failure (TTF), and safety. Results 222 pts were enrolled with 153 randomized after completion of CRT and PCI, 78 to C and 75 to O. Median age 62 years, 60% males, 34%/65% current/former smokers, 31%/66% ECOG PS 0/1. In C, 40 PFS events were observed, with median PFS 10.7 m (95% CI 7.0-Not Estimable (NE)) vs 42 events and median 14.5 m (8.2-NE) in O, HR=1.02 (0.66-1.58), 2-sided p=0.93. Two-year PFS rate was 43% (31-55) and 40% (28-52) in C and O respectively. Median OS was not reached in C, while it was 31.6 m (26.1-NE) in O, HR=1.06 (0.61-1.86), p=0.83. One-year OS rate was 79% (68-87) in C and 89% (78-94) in O. Exploratory subgroups will be presented. In C, median time to treatment discontinuation was only 1.7 m. Grade\u22653 AEs were experienced by 62% pts in C and 25% in O, with 4 and 1 fatal AE, respectively. Conclusions PFS for LS-SCLC pts is not found different between C and O, possibly due to the short period on active treatment observed in the study. Clinical trial identification NCT02046733.

BID TRT of 45 Gy is the most recommended schedule. Only 30% are cured, and there is a need for better treatment. A higher TRT dose might improve local control and survival, and we conducted a phase II trial comparing BID TRT of 45 Gy with 60 Gy. There have been major concerns about toxicity from BID TRT. Here we present the patient reported health-related quality of life (HRQoL) from our trial. Methods Patients received 4 courses of platinum/etoposide (PE) and were randomized to receive TRT of 45 or 60 Gy after the second PE-course. Responders received prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) of 25-30 Gy. Patients reported HRQoL on the EORTC QLQ C30/LC13 at weeks 0, 4 (before TRT), 8 (end of TRT), 12 (response evaluation), 16 (end of PCI), 22, 32, 42 and 52. Primary HRQoL-endpoints were dysphagia, dyspnea, global QoL and physical function. A difference in mean score of \u226510 was considered clinically relevant. Results Between 2014-2018, 160 patients eligible for the present analyses were enrolled. Median age was 65, 58% women, 10% had PS 2 and 81% stage III. There were no significant differences in objectively assessed toxicity, and there was less radiotoxicity than in many previous studies. The high-dose arm achieved a significantly improved 2-year survival (primary endpoint) (46% vs. 70%; p=.002) and median overall survival (23 vs. 42 months; p=.027). The completion rate of questionnaires at each timepoint ranged from 61%-76%. Patients reported an increase in dysphagia from TRT with a max. level at w8 (45 Gy: mean score 45.1 points, 60 Gy: 51.9). 60 Gy patients had more dysphagia at w12 (45 Gy: 18.3, 60 Gy: 32.8) and w16 (45 Gy: 7.3, 60 Gy: 18.4), but after w22, the level of dysphagia returned to pre-treatment values in both arms. There were no significant differences in dyspnea, global quality of life or physical functioning, or on any other HRQoL scales, at any timepoint. Conclusions High-dose BID TRT significantly improved survival and was well tolerated both in terms of toxicity and patient reported HRQoL, though some patients on the high-dose arm needed a longer time to recover from radiation-induced dysphagia.

Limited by the low incidence rates of fusions and MSI-H, the association between these two biomarkers remains largely unknown. Here we aimed at characterizing the distribution of fusions and MSI-H in 20296 solid tumors. Methods Hybrid capture-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) were performed in 20296 samples of solid tumors and matched normal pairs in a CAP/CLIA-approved laboratory (3DMed). NGS testing for germline and somatic mutations, copy number variation, fusion, and MSI were implemented. Results Of the 20296 tumor samples, MSI-H and fusion of  ALK / RET / ROS1 / FGFR / NTRK  were observed in 620 (3.05%) and 410 samples (2.02%), respectively. MSI-H was relatively more prevalent in tumors of uterus (11.03%), intestine (7.85%), and stomach (4.98%), while 78.5% of fusion events were observed in lung cancers. In total, the incidence rate of fusion was higher in the MSI-H samples, compared to the MSS samples (3.06% vs. 1.99%, OR=1.56, P=0.079). This positive correlation was remarkably significant in cancers of intestine (OR=21.73, P=1.64*10 -12 ), where merely 9 fusions (6 of RET, 2 of NTRK, and 1 of ALK) were observed in 4507 MSS samples (0.20%), while 16 fusions (4 of RET, 8 of NTRK, and 4 of ALK) were detected in 384 MSI-H samples (7.85%).

Since the auto-immune toxicities with ICIs can be fatal, it is critical to optimize patient selection criteria. The current use of PD-L1 level and mismatch-repair/microsatellite-instability status has limitations. Recently tumor mutational burden (TMB) has emerged as a promising biomarker for ICI response. Accurate TMB estimation requires patient germline sequencing to filter out non-somatic variants; however, TMB is often calculated from tumor-only sequencing, relying on public databases (DB) to filter out non-somatic polymorphisms. We previously reported that filtering based on public DB significantly inflated TMBs. In this study, we investigated the impact of under-representation of minority ethnic groups in these DB and hypothesized that the inflation of TMBs will be racially disparate with falsely higher TMB in Black  vs.  White individuals. Methods Variants were identified in individual tumor and germline exomes of 157 Black and 713 White patients sequenced by Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF). TMBs for each patient were calculated using 4 filtering criteria: (1) excluding variants in paired germline exomes; (2) excluding variants with minor allele frequency (MAF) \u2265 1% in 1000G/ExAc DB; (3) excluding variants with MAF \u2265 0.1% in 1000G/ExAc; and (4) excluding all variants in 1000G/ExAc. Results Compared to the gold standard of filtering germline variants by patient-paired germline sequencing data, TMBs were significantly higher in both Black and White patients using public DB for filtering regardless of the MAF thresholds. Furthermore, the TMBs were more significantly overestimated in Blacks compared to Whites (Table).

A comprehensive assessment of the distribution of alts in HR genes in a large pan-cancer data set could guide clinical management and trial design. Methods Genomic profiling on up to 465 genes, including core and peripheral HR genes  BRCA1 ,  BRCA2 ,  PALB2 ,  ATR ,  ATRX ,  ATM ,  BAP1 ,  RAD51B ,  RAD51C ,  RAD51D ,  BRIP1 ,  NBN ,  CHEK1 ,  CHEK2 ,  FANCA ,  FANCC  and  MRE11  was performed in a pan-cancer cohort of \u223c150,000 tumour samples (Foundation Medicine, Inc.). Zygosity predictions, gLOH and biallelic status were calculated as described (PMID:  29415044 ;  27908594 ). Results HR alts were identified in 18.5% of samples (Table). In  BRCA -associated (BA) cancers (ovarian, breast, pancreas, prostate), most HR alts were predicted biallelic (75.0%), with a lower rate in non-BA (NBA) cancers (45.7%). Biallelic HR alts had elevated gLOH relative to HR wildtype (HR-WT) (BA: median [med] gLOH 19.2 v 9.7, p <1e-100; NBA: med gLOH 11.0 v 7.1, p <1e-100). Monoallelic alts were not associated with elevated gLOH (p = 1.0). The strength of association between biallelic HR alts and gLOH was strongest in  BRCA1 ,  RAD51D ,  PALB2 ,  RAD51C  and  BRCA2  (med gLOH 25.5, 21.6, 19.8, 19.3, 19.0 v 7.8 in HR-WT, all p <1e-25). Other genes exhibited weak or no association with gLOH (all med gLOH <15). Additional analyses will be presented examining variant somatic/germline status.

Because of the paucity of CUP cases and the ill-defined treatment guidelines, patients have poor prognoses. In efforts to improve patient outcomes, the efficacy of a personalized genomic matched N-of-One approach including tailored combination therapies was investigated. Methods Overall, 97 tumors had next-generation sequencing (NGS) of tissue (N=74) and/or cell-free DNA (cfDNA) (N=72). Immune biomarkers including PD-L1 immunohistochemistry, microsatellite instability (MSI) status, and tumor mutation burden (TMB) were also evaluated. Matching Score (MS) (the number of targeted deleterious genomic alterations divided by the total number of deleterious alterations) was assessed for patients. Results Overall, 59 of 97 patients (60.8%) were women; median age at diagnosis was 63 years (range, 21-95). The median number of alterations for 74 patients with tissue NGS was 4 (range, 0-25); most commonly altered genes were  TP53 , 55.4% (41/74);  CDKN2A,  24.3%; and  KRAS,  20.3%. The median number of alterations for 72 patients with cfDNA was 2 (range, 0-9); most common altered genes were  TP53,  61.1% (44/72);  KRAS,  22.2%; and  PIK3CA,  16.7%. Overall, 30.9% of 55 patients tested for PD-L1 were positive (defined as \u22651% on tumor [n = 16] or tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes [n = 1]); 9.4% (6/64) of tumors had high TMB (\u226520 mutations/mb), while 3.6% (2/55) were MSI-High. Clinical outcomes for 62 patients were evaluable. Comparing patients with high degrees of matching of alterations to therapies (MS\u226550%; n=15) versus low MS (<50%;n=47, including 25 with no matched therapy), median progression-free survival was 10.4 vs. 2.8 months (95% CI 0.11-0.64; HR 0.27; P=0.002); median overall survival, 15.8 vs. 6.9 months (95% CI 0.17-1.16; HR 0.45; P=0.09). The disease control rate (stable disease \u22656 months plus partial or complete response) was significantly higher in the high vs. low MS group (71% vs. 24%; P=0.003). Conclusions Among patients with CUP, personalized combination treatments with high degrees of molecular matching to genomic alterations (MS\u226550%) were associated with improved outcomes.

Ultra low pass whole genome sequencing (ulpWGS) allows estimation of the tumour-derived fraction in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) without prior sequencing of primary tumour, and could improve BCLM diagnosis when CSF cytology is equivocal. Methods cfDNA was extracted from CSF collected at the time of diagnostic lumbar puncture in patients with breast cancer undergoing investigation for BCLM (n = 25). ulpWGS (0.1X) and estimation of tumour-derived cfDNA fraction (CSF TF) was performed. Serial CSF TF were also measured from patients subsequently undergoing intrathecal therapy for confirmed BCLM. Results In 32% (8/25) multiple CSF sampling was performed due to initial negative or equivocal cytology. 20/25 cases had confirmed BCLM: positive MRI and CSF cytology (14/25, 56%); MRI only (3/25, 12%), or cytology only (3/25, 12%). The remaining 5/25 had suspected but non-confirmed BCLM, with negative CSF cytology (5/25) and normal (4/25) or borderline (1/25) MRI findings. At median 20 months follow up, these patients had no evidence of BCLM. CSF TF in confirmed cases was significantly higher (median 61.2%) than non-confirmed BCLM (median 5.0%) (p <0.0001). In those with confirmed BCLM, CSF TF was similar regardless of variable final cytology status (Table). Serial sampling showed that CSF TF changed in response to intrathecal therapy, while CSF cytology and MRI were often unchanged or equivocal. Relapse of BCLM during intrathecal chemotherapy was detected up to 4 weeks before clinical deterioration.

Better understanding of mechanisms contributing to response to ICB will provide a rationale for future combination treatments. By combining unbiased profiling of circulating immune cells in patients treated with ICB with mechanistic studies in mouse models, we aimed to study the role of myeloid cells in ICB response. Methods Multiparameter flow cytometry was performed on fresh blood from metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients in the phase 2 TONIC trial (n=111) before start and after 3 cycles of anti-PD1. In addition, we used genetically engineered mouse models of primary and metastatic breast cancer for mechanistic studies. Finally, we validated our findings in 5 cancer types: metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; n=55), metastatic bladder cancer (n=34), metastatic mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) cancer (n=11) and early-stage dMMR (n=21) or MMR-proficient (pMMR) colon cancer (CC; n=17). RNA-sequencing was available for the TNBC and CC trials. Results A significant increase in circulating eosinophils during ICB was observed in patients with TNBC responding to ICB (p=0.002), but not in non-responders. In breast cancer mouse models that respond to dual ICB and cisplatin, we found that ICB response was lost upon depletion of eosinophils. Importantly, we found that an increase in eosinophils was also associated with response in NSCLC (p=0.03), early-stage pMMR CC (p=0.04) and in bladder cancer (p=0.05), but not in early-stage or metastatic dMMR tumors. Furthermore, we observed increased expression of eosinophil-related genes upon ICB in tumors of responders with metastatic TNBC and early-stage CC. Conclusions An increase in eosinophils is associated with ICB response in multiple tumor types and studies in mouse models uncovered a functional role for eosinophils during ICB response. These data indicate that eosinophils are mechanistically involved in response to ICB. Future combination strategies should consider engaging eosinophils to increase ICB efficacy.

Overall survival in early- and advanced-stage disease is poor. Methods TNBC-MERIT is a phase I trial (NCT02316457) assessing the feasibility, safety and immunogenicity of a liposome-formulated intravenous RNA vaccine encoding different tumor antigen categories in TNBC patients after surgery and (neo-)adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients in two arms of this trial received a personalized set of pre-manufactured non-mutated shared tumor-associated antigens with or without universal T helper epitopes. In a third arm, patients were vaccinated with IVAC_M_ uID , an on-demand manufactured Individualized NeoAntigen Specific Immunotherapy (iNeST) encoding neoepitopes derived from up to 20 cancer mutations determined by NGS. This report provides a preliminary data analysis of immune responses in IVAC_M_ uID -vaccinated patients as analyzed by IFN\u03b3-ELISpot, multimer staining, TCR repertoire profiling and single cell TCR sequencing (data final mid-2020). Results Immunogenicity data was generated from all 14 IVAC_M_ uID -treated patients. All analyzed patients had vaccine-induced CD4 +  and/or CD8 +  T-cell responses against 1 to 10 of the vaccine neoepitopes detected by IFN\u03b3 ELISpot,  ex vivo  or after  in vitro  stimulation. A substantial number of T-cell responses against individual neoepitopes were induced  de novo  and of high magnitude (up to 10.3% of peripheral CD8 T cells). One of the index patients characterized in more detail mounted CD4 +  and/or CD8 +  T-cell responses against 10 of 20 vaccine neoepitopes. The highly poly-epitopic TCR-clonotype diversified CD8 +  T-cell response comprised in aggregate about 30% of total peripheral CD8 +  T cells and was sustained at high levels for at least 6 months after the last vaccination.

Phosphatases are druggable targets but their role in HER2 therapy resistance is poorly understood. Dual specificity phosphatase (DUSP) 1 & 6 have key roles in tumor cell growth and apoptosis and their blockade augments chemosensitivity in human neoplasms. Here, we investigated the contribution of DUSP1 & 6 to resistance to HER2 inhibitors in breast cancer. Methods Genome editing; cell viability; Western blotting; RNA-seq; synergy analysis; xenograft, intracranial inoculation. Results DUSPs inhibition by RNAi and CRISPR procedures reduced cell viability and increased sensitivity to HER2 inhibitors in drug resistant cells and DUSPs overexpression promoted drug resistance in senstive cells. In an acquired resistant model with long-term exposure to Lapatinib, DUSP6 was highly expressed in the early stages of drug treatment and combination of Lapatinib or Neratinib with BCI, a DUSP1 & 6 inhibitor, prevented development of resistant clones. The AKT inhibitor MK2206 in combination with HER2-directed therapies is in clinical trials for the resistant disease. We found that compared to MK2206, BCI in combination with Lapatinib induced apoptosis in resistant cells. While MK2206 increased the expression of HER2 & HER3, BCI alone or in combination with Lapatinib reduced both HER2 and HER3. Consistently, RNAi-mediated depletion of DUSP6 reduced HER2 & HER3, implying for DUSP6-mediated regulation of HER2 & HER3. Moreover, mice injected intracranially with DUSP6 knockout cells had longer survival, compared with CAS9. Microenvironmental-mediated resistance to HER2 inhibitors occurs by the HER3 ligand heregulin (HRG). We found that BCI, but not MK2206, abrogates HRG-induced rescue in sensitive cells. Ultimately, a BCI+Lapatinib combination therapy reduced tumor growth in a xenograft model of resistant cells. Conclusions DUSP1 & 6 promote both inherent & acquired resistance to HER2 inhibitors and their inhibition provides important advantages over AKT blockade. Further investigation of the expression of DUSP1 & 6 in followed-up patients is warranted to further validate their role in resistance to HER2 inhibitors.

Cancer Res 2016;76:2301]. For these compelling evidences the present study evaluated the impact of PI3K mutations on treatment outcome in metastatic BC (mBC) patients (pts) receiving CDK4/6i in association with hormonal therapy as per approved indication. Methods Thirty pts treated with palbociclib (n=26) or ribociclib (n=4) plus hormonal therapy were enrolled. Plasma samples were obtained prior to CDK4/6i treatment and circulating free DNA (cfDNA) extraction was performed using the QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit (Qiagen). PI3K mutations (C420R, E542K, E545A, E545D, E545G, E545K, Q546E, Q546R, H1047L, H1047R, H1047Y) were analysed on cfDNA using a QX100 ddPCR (Bio-Rad). Results In pts with (n=12) vs. without (n=18) PI3K mutations, PFS was significantly shorter (5.9 vs 11.6 months, p=0.01, respectively). The univariate and multivariate analysis comparing PFS and clinically relevant data (i.e., age, metastasis, previous lines of hormonal or chemotherapy), confirmed PI3K as the only biomarker significantly associated to PFS (p=0.01). A significant correlation was observed between Ki67 expression in primary lesions and PI3K status. Higher Ki67 levels were associated with PI3K mutations vs. none (Ki67%, 25.36\u00b111.02 vs. 13.17\u00b110.14; p=0.006). The significance was maintained when PI3K mutant pts were stratified as low (<14%), intermediate (14\u201320%) and high (>20%) Ki67 levels (p=0.009). Despite the strong correlation, Ki67 did not appear significantly associated with median PFS to CDK4/6i, and the presence of PI3K mutations remained an independent predictor of clinical outcome to CDK4/6i. Conclusions In conclusion, PI3K status should be considered a potential predictive biomarker of CDK4/6i and, based on these data, the sequence of treatments (CDK4/6 vs. PI3Ki) may be reconsidered.

Methods 14 pre- and 18 post-treatment tumors were transplanted into immunocompromised mice. Xenografts were profiled using a capture-based exome sequencing panel and analyzed by immunohistochemistry as well as for the  in vivo  antiproliferative activity of P plus the patient-matched ET. Models of acquired resistance were generated from responder models and characterized. Predictive markers of response were analyzed and, in the case of non-responder models, additional treatments were tested  in vivo  and/or  ex vivo . Results Successful engraftments were established in 3 of the 32 tumors (take rate 9%, 95% CI 1.8% -23.1%). Of those, PDX426 and PDX446 derived from pre-treatment tumors of patients receiving P+L and P+F, respectively, and PDX450 from a post-treatment tumor of a patient treated with P+L. PDX426 harbored an  FGFR1  amplification and PDX446 harbored concomitant  PIK3CA  and  PTEN  mutations. Both PDXs expressed normal levels of pRb and cyclin E1. PDX446 showed sensitivity to P+F or P+L for >95 days, resembling the patient\u2019s clinical response. Of note, PDX446 was also sensitive to single-agent F or L. The model of acquired resistance to P+F exhibited lower expression of pRb than the sensitive model. PDX450 harbored concomitant  ESR1 ,  PIK3CA , and  PTEN  mutations and expressed low pRb. Despite an initial response, all tumors progressed to P+L after 80 days, matching the clinical disease progression. The P+L-resistant tumors were also resistant to P+F  in vivo  but sensitive to the PI3K-\u03b1 inhibitor alpelisib plus F  ex vivo . Conclusions PDX models showed comparable treatment responses to those observed clinically, providing information about the additional benefit of P to ET alone as well as effective treatment options in the post-P setting.

Methods Patients aged \u2265 65 years who were diagnosed with breast cancer from 2004 to 2015 in a large Canadian province were identified from population-based registry. Patients were categorized as old (65-74 years), older (75-84 years) and oldest (\u2265 85 years). Multivariable logistic and Cox regression analyses were performed to identify associations of CVD with cancer treatment and to determine its effect on overall survival (OS). Results We identified 9,682 patients with breast cancer and the median age was 73 years. Of these, 54.3% were old, 32.9% were older, and 12.8% were oldest. While early breast cancer was diagnosed in 70.4%, 24.0% and 5.6% had locally advanced and metastatic disease. The prevalence of pre-existing CVD was 21.5% and increased with advancing age (13.2% in old patients vs. 40.9% in oldest patients; P<0.001). On multivariable logistic regression, CVD was associated with lower odds of receiving appropriate chemotherapy (odds ratio [OR], 0.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.42-0.68;  P  < .0001) and radiotherapy (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.57-0.78;  P  < .0001), but not surgery (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.76-1.04;  P  =0.155). The 5-year OS was lower in patients with baseline CVD as compared to those without (77.9% vs 49.8%,  P  <0.001). Upon adjusting for stage and treatment, CVD continued to correlate with worse survival (hazard ratio, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.46-1.71;  P  < .0001). The 5-year OS of the old, older, and oldest patients were 84.3%, 67.0% and 35.4%, respectively.

Effects of oncologic rehabilitation on physical activity (PA) in this specific patient population is unknown. This study investigated whether oncologic rehabilitation increased PA in patients receiving adjuvant ET for BC. Methods Eligible patients for this multicenter, prospective clinical trial were female, aged 18-75, receiving adjuvant ET for BC, and with a BMI \u2265 25 (NCT02424292). All patients attended a 12-week moderate-intensity aerobic- and resistance exercise program. Moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) was measured by an accelerometer at baseline (T0), after 12 and 26 weeks (T1 and T2). Primary endpoint was change in proportion of patients with weekly \u2265 150 minutes of MVPA (national guideline recommendations), at T1 compared to T0. Secondary endpoints were metabolic syndrome (MetS), body composition, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and breast cancer-specific functioning and symptoms (EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23), self-reported PA (PASE), self-efficacy (ALCOS), exercise motivation (PACE) and overall satisfaction with life. Results In total, 141 patients with a median age of 61 yrs [54-66] and mean BMI of 31.3 \u00b1 4.4 participated. Proportion of patients with weekly \u2265 150 minutes of MVPA increased from 38.6% at T0, to 48.7% at T1 and 56.3% at T2 [\u03c7 2 (2) = 8.977,  p  = .011]. Moreover, MetS, body composition and symptoms (i.e. fatigue) significantly decreased while HRQoL, functioning, self-reported PA, self-efficacy, exercise motivation and satisfaction with life all increased significantly at T1 and T2 compared to T0. Conclusions Oncologic rehabilitation significantly increased PA and HRQoL in overweight or obese BC patients, receiving adjuvant ET. Furthermore, MetS, body composition and fatigue significantly decreased. Our findings highlight the beneficial effect of oncologic rehabilitation in these patients, who are particularly vulnerable for poor health outcome. Clinical trial identification NCT02424292.

However, data on readmissions in oncology services is still limited. So, we planned to evaluate the rates and causes of early readmissions and the predisposing factors in our institution. Methods Patients who were hospitalized in Hacettepe University Oncology services between 01.08.2018-31.07.2019 were included. The patients' demographic features, tumor stages, regularly used drugs, comorbidities, last complete blood count and biochemistry parameters, presence and reasons for readmissions in the first 30 days after discharge were recorded. The predisposing features were evaluated with univariate and multivariate analyses. Results A total of 562 hospitalizations were included in the analyses. The median age of the patients was 61 (19-96). Almost two-thirds of the hospitalizations were due to symptom palliation and infections. 83% of the patients had advanced disease and over 60% had an ECOG performance score of 2 and above. In the first 30 days after discharge, 127 patients were readmitted to the hospital (22.6%). Of these readmissions, 56 (44.1%) were direct to inpatient service, 61 (48%) were to the emergency department, and 10 (7.9%) were intensive care hospitalizations. In 39 patients (30.7%), the reason for first hospitalization and readmission was the same. Advanced stage disease (stage 4 vs 1-3), presence of polypharmacy (5 or more regular drugs), emergency hospitalization (emergency vs. ambulatory), and hypoalbuminemia (<3 gr/dL) were associated with a statistically significant increase in the risk of readmission. Among these factors, advanced-stage disease (HR: 2.847, 95% CI: 1.375-5.895), emergency hospitalization (HR: 1.832, 95% CI: 1.208-2.777), and polypharmacy (HR: 1.782, 95% CI: 1.173-2.706) remained significant in multivariate analyses. Conclusions In this study, 22% of the oncology patients had readmission in the first 30 days after discharge. The readmission risk increased significantly in patients with advanced disease, emergency hospitalization, and polypharmacy. The optimal post-discharge plan may reduce readmissions in all oncology patients, with priority for these patient groups. Legal entity responsible for the study The authors.

We hypothesized whether neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the intramuscular adipose tissue/skeletal muscle index (IMAC/SMI) are associated with prognosis in metastatic NSCLC (mNSCLC). We also considered the quality of life (QoL) assessed via the EORTC-QLQ-CAX24 questionnaire on the prognosis of mNSCLC. Methods We analyzed a prospective cohort study (Apr/2017 to May/2020) of pts diagnosed with histologically-proven, treatment-naive, mNSCLC. After signed informed consent, we evaluated pts about demographic features and QoL using the EORTC-QLQ-C30 and -CAX24 scales. We used the baseline NLR as a surrogate of systemic inflammation. IMAC/SMI was evaluated using baseline plain computed tomography imaging at the third lumbar vertebra level. To test our hypothesis that NLR and IMAC/SMI are associated with prognosis, we carried out a Cox multivariate regression and included age, gender, ECOG-PS, and histology as covariates. Results We collected 128 pts, median age 65 y.o. (23-86), 79 (62%) male. Lung adenocarcinoma was the predominant histology (66%). ECOG-PS was classified as 0-1 in 27 pts (21%) and 2-4 in 101 pts (79%). Median overall survival was 468, 335, 106, 59, and 20 days in pts with ECOG-PS 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Elevated NLR (Hazard ratio (HR) = 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) = [1.01 - 1.59], p=0.038), IMAC/SMI ratio (HR = 1.37, 95% CI = [1.03 - 1.84], p=0.032), and CAX24 score for food aversion (HR = 1.52, 95% CI = [1.13 - 2.03], p=0.006) were associated with worse prognosis in mNSCLC. Indeed, higher ECOG-PS (Spearman rho=0.208, p=0.027), CAX24 scores for food aversion (rho=0.197, p=0.036), loss of control (rho=0.212, p=0.024), and eating and weight loss worry domains (rho=0.219, p=0.020) were associated with elevated NLR levels. Conclusions Elevated NLR, IMAC/SMA ratio, and CAX24 score for food aversion are independently associated with worse survival in mNSCLC. These data underscore the importance of cachexia features as negative prognostic factors in mNSCLC. Clinical trial identification NCT03960034. Legal entity responsible for the study The authors.

Anti-emetic prophylaxis is additionally challenging during induction chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where the role of aprepitant has not been formally evaluated. Methods A randomized, open-label trial was conducted at our centre where chemotherapy na\u00efve children between 5-18 years with diagnosis of AML being planned for induction chemotherapy (3+7 regimen) were included. All study participants received ondansetron (0.15mg/kg) 8 hourly for 8 days starting 30min prior to chemotherapy. Children belonging to aprepitant group additionally received aprepitant capsules (15-40 kg = days 1-3, 80 mg; >40 kg = day 1, 125 mg and days 2-3, 80 mg) starting from 1 h before chemotherapy. The proportion of patients with CIV in acute phase (day 1-day 8), delayed phase (day 9-day 13) and reported adverse effects were recorded. Acute and delayed nausea was also recorded as secondary end point. Results Total of 78 children were randomized (37 in the aprepitant group and 41 in the control group). The proportion of participants achieving a complete response in CIV was significantly higher in the aprepitant group compared to the control group overall (51% vs 22%; p=0.007) and especially in the acute phase (59% vs 29%; p=0.007). The time to the first episode of vomiting was also significantly higher in the aprepitant group (p=0.0004). The reported adverse events were similar between the two groups. There was no difference in acute and delayed nausea. Conclusions The use of aprepitant as add-on prophylactic anti-emetic during induction chemotherapy for AML significantly improves CIV rate in children especially in acute phase.

Methods In this open-label, multicenter study, chemo-na\u00efve lung cancer patients receiving cisplatin (>=70 mg/m 2 ), were given a single oral dose of NEPA and DEX (12 mg i.v.) prior to chemotherapy and randomized (1:1:1) to receive no further DEX (DEX1), oral DEX (4 mg once daily) on days 2 and 3 (DEX3), or oral DEX (4 mg twice daily) on days 2 to 4 (DEX4; reference arm). The primary efficacy endpoint was complete response (CR: no emesis and no use of rescue medication) during the overall (days 1-5) phase. Non-inferiority was defined as a lower 95% CI greater than the non-inferiority margin threshold of -15% difference (Arms DEX1 or DEX3 minus Arm DEX4). Impact of Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV) on daily life as assessed by the Functional Living Index-Emesis (FLIE) questionnaire was also evaluated. Results A total of 222 patients (76% male), 74 in each arm, were evaluated. CR rates during the overall and delayed phases were 77.0% in Arms DEX1 and DEX3 and 74.3% in Arm DEX4 (95% CI, -11.1% to 16.5%). No significant differences were observed between groups in proportions of patients who reported no impact on daily life due to nausea, vomiting, or both during the 5-day observation period after cisplatin administration. Conclusions Since efficacy results were comparable between the two DEX-sparing regimens in this study, we conclude that the simplified three-drug regimen with NEPA plus single-dose DEX is an option that is not associated with significant reduction in anti-emetic control during the 5-day period or an impact on patient functioning in the setting of cisplatin.

This MASCC study was undertaken to prospectively evaluate the incidence of CINV in pts undergoing carboplatin-based chemotherapy receiving guidelines consistent CINV prophylaxis (GCCP). All sites did not prescribe NK1-RA as it is not included in all institutional guidelines. Methods The study enrolled 207 pts undergoing carboplatin-based chemotherapy, the current analysis evaluated cycle 1 of the first 155 pts. Pt diaries were used to collect data from day 1-10 beginning with cycle 1. Nausea was reported by the pts using a visual analog scale (VAS) with the end-point being no nausea. Vomiting episodes were recorded in the pts\u2019 diaries. Results There were 103 females and 52 males, with a mean age of 64 (30-85). The overall incidence of acute and delayed nausea for was 17% and 25% respectively. The incidence of nausea of entire population was significantly higher than vomiting (58% vs. 14%; Chi 2  22.271 p<0.000). The use of NK1-RA was associated with a significant decrease in time to first vomiting for cycle 1 (p<0.041) and subsequent cycle 2-6 (p<0.0075). Time to first nausea was not significant for cycle 1 or subsequent cycles. In a logistic regression model factors associated with acute nausea in cycle 1 included history of motion sickness (p< 0.0090), comorbidities (p< 0.0084), history of morning sickness (p< 0.0090), previous chemotherapy (p< 0.0096), anemia (p< 0.0209). A separate logistic regression analysis for delayed nausea in cycle 1 showed that prior radiotherapy (p<0.0093) and a history of morning sickness (p<0.0195) were significant. Conclusions Despite GCCP and the usage of NK1-RA, carboplatin induced nausea remains a major unmet medical need in cancer pts. Further research should focus on management of nausea, risk factors and the impact of nausea on quality of life and in pts undergoing carboplatin-based treatment. Clinical trial identification ICES.

Few data exist on the long-term effects of G-CSF on quality of life and hematological toxicity. Methods EBC pts (stage I-III) treated with CT were identified from the prospective, longitudinal, multicenter CANTO cohort (NCT01993498). PRO data (EORTC QLQ-C30/BR23) and blood cell counts were obtained at diagnosis (baseline) and at year (Y)1, Y2, and Y4 after diagnosis. Our primary outcome was QLQ-C30 pain score. Exploratory outcomes included all QLQ domains, C30 summary score (Husson O, 2020), leucocyte and platelet count. The independent variable was G-CSF use. Multivariable mixed models examined associations of G-CSF use with outcomes. Results Among 2926 pts included from 2012-15, 49% (n=1427) used G-CSF and 51% (n=1499) did not. Baseline mean age was 53 years (SD=11), >80% pts received non dose-dense anthracyclines + taxanes regimens. Pts receiving G-CSF were older, had higher stage BC and worse baseline PRO (Table). Over time, pain score was not statistically different between groups (adjusted overall mean difference [adjMD] vs no-use [95% CI]: +1.32 [-0.28 to +2.92]). Consistently, remaining PRO were substantially similar between groups, including summary score (adjMD vs no-use [95% CI]: -1.04 [-2.01 to -0.08]).

Intermediate results from the MeTHOS study", "description": "Background Cancer is implicated in multiple pathways increasing thrombogenicity. Cance associated thrombosis can delay cancer treatment and results in increased mortality, morbidity, and surcharge on healthcare resources. An effective antithrombotic strategy in high-risk patients (pts) in postoperative and chemotherapy periods may improve outcome. Methods The Metaxas\u2019s Hospital THromboprophylaxis program in Oncological & Surgical Patients (MeTHOS), is a prospective observational study aiming to record our thromboprophylaxis program in high-risk active cancer pts undergoing surgical and/or chemotherapy treatment. According to our program, patients receiving tinzaparin (fixed dose of 0,5 ml, 10.000 Anti-Xa IU, OD) were enrolled after signing informed consent. Results We report intermediate results of the MeTHOS study for 237 enrolled ambulatory pts receiving chemotherapy. There were 55% males and 45% females, with median age 67.0 years (interquartile range (IQR): 59-74 years). Primary cancers included GI 35%, lung 20%, gynecological 16%, urinary 9% and others 20%; 67% of patients had metastatic disease; 90% were receiving Highly Thrombogenic Agents (HTAs) e.g. platinum, taxanes, 5-FU and antiangiogenics; 20% had undergone surgery; 62% had a history of cardiovascular disease, 32% diabetes, 31% respiratory disease, 38% dyslipidemia and 19% prior thrombosis; 22% had central venous catheter; 27% were smokers and 40% ex-smokers. Median duration of tinzaparin administration was 6.9mo (IQR: 3.7-12.0 mo). Four pts experienced thrombotic events (1.7%, 95%CI: 0.5-4.3%, 3 DVT, 1 PE). Seven bleeding events were recorded (3.0%, 95%CI: 1.2-6.0%); 5 of them were graded as minor. Thrombotic risk was higher in patients with thrombosis history (OR: 4.2), metastatic disease (OR: 2.8) and diabetes (OR: 2.2). Conclusions Thromboprophylaxis with tinzaparin in active cancer pts receiving chemotherapy was safe and effective. Cancer pts may tolerate higher doses of LMWH without increasing bleeding events. A high-thrombotic burden-adapted strategy with more effective LMWH doses, could benefit high risk pts without compromising safety. Further research is needed.

Patients with cancer may be at particularly high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and deleterious outcomes to the disease. A better understanding of potential host risk factors, notably  ACE2  and  TMPRSS2 , in malignant tissues may inform considerations surrounding SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 in patients with cancer and more broadly in the general population. Methods We performed a large-scale integrated study of  ACE2  and  TMPRSS2  gene expression in 10,038 patients with cancer across and within organ systems, by normal  versus  tumor. We investigated its correlative pattern with clinical factors (age, gender, race, BMI and smoking history, etc.), HLA, immune signatures, and commensal microbiome. Results Matched normal tissues generally display higher  ACE2  and  TMPRSS2  expression compared with tumor, with digestive organs expressing the highest levels. No consistent association was observed between clinical groups or HLA genotypes and  ACE2 / TMPRSS2  levels, after adjusting for tissue-specific expression.  ACE2  expression showed a significant correlation with clinically relevant immune signatures including interferon-stimulated genes and the T cell-inflamed phenotype, and with macrophage cell subsets. Single-cell RNAseq analysis demonstrated little to no  ACE2  or  TMPRSS2  expression in lymphocytes or macrophages.  ACE2  and  TMPRSS2  showed a distinctive correlative pattern with 75 bacterial taxa in normal tissues particularly from colorectal cancers (gram-negative to positive ratio = 2.6:1). LASSO regression models integrating multi-dimensional correlates revealed immune and microbiota are among the top-ranked features predicting  ACE2  expression, while epithelial cell abundance is the dominant predictor for  TMPRSS2 . Conclusions We investigated  ACE2  and  TMPRSS2  expression across clinical, genetic, immune, and microbiome domains. We identify novel associations with the microbiota and confirm host immunity associations with gene expression. We hope these data may better inform clinical considerations surrounding risk stratification and prevention approaches. Legal entity responsible for the study The authors.

European guidelines advise to defer ICI therapy until complete resolution of COVID-19. However, mechanistic insight into how ICI impacts COVID-19 immunopathology is absent. Methods We performed single-cell RNA- and T-Cell Receptor-sequencing (TCR-seq) on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of COVID-19 pneumonia (n=19) and non-COVID pneumonia (n=10), and co-analyzed CD8+ T-cells with publicly available tumor-infiltrating T-cell data of treatment-na\u00efve and ICI-treated patients (Sade-Feldman, Cell, 2018; Lambrechts, Nat Med, 2018). Cell lineages were determined by trajectory inference (Slingshot, Monocle v2) and stratified per condition. Pathogen- or tumor-directed T-cells were defined based on clonal selection (Zhang, Nature, 2018). To identify ICI responsive cells, we calculated a score derived from a validated gene set denoting ICI reactivity (Okamura, J. Autoimmun, 2019). Results We identified 3 CD8+ T-cell lineages, with \u2018Na\u00efve\u2019 T-cells transitioning into \u2018Effector Memory\u2019 cells and then branching into either \u2018Recently Activated Effector Memory (T EMRA )\u2019, \u2018Exhausted (T EX )\u2019 or \u2018Resident Memory (T RM )\u2019 T-cells. In COVID-19, clonal expansion indicating a SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific T-cell response, was mainly observed in the highly cytotoxic \u2018T EMRA \u2019 lineage. In contrast, tumor-specific T-cells were found in the \u2018T EX \u2019 lineage. Of importance, the ICI responsiveness score was significantly higher in the non-pathogen-directed \u2018T RM \u2019 and \u2018T EX \u2019 cells in COVID-19.

Whereas ICI reactivates tumor-directed \u2018exhausted\u2019 T-cells in cancer, it preferentially potentiates non-pathogen-directed T-cells in COVID-19, thereby contributing to lung damage without boosting the antiviral immune response.

Currently, there are no robust data supporting the efficacy, safety and recommendation for influenza vaccination in cancer patients receiving ICI. Methods The prospective, multicenter, observational INVIDIa-2 study investigated the clinical efficacy of influenza vaccination in advanced cancer patients with solid tumors receiving ICI between October 2019 and January 2020. The incidence of influenza-like illness (ILI, primary endpoint) was observed until April 30, 2020. Secondary endpoints included a non-prespecified analysis for COVID-19. Results The study enrolled 1279 patients; 1188 were evaluable. Of them, 11 patients developed ILI symptoms with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 (incidence of 0.9% and lethality of 72%, irrespective of the flu vaccination). Of the remaining 1177 patients, 574 received flu vaccination (48.8%). The ILI incidence was 7.7% (91 patients of 1177). Patients receiving the flu vaccine were significantly more frequently elderly ( p <0.0001), former or active smokers ( p <0.0001), affected by lung cancer ( p =0.017) and by non-cancer comorbidities ( p <0.0001) when compared to unvaccinated patients. The flu vaccine did not prevent ILI in the study population, irrespective of the vaccine type (quadrivalent  vs  trivalent, adjuvated  vs  non): the incidence of ILI was 8.2% in vaccinated  vs  7.3% in unvaccinated patients ( p =0.57). ILI complications were significantly less frequent for patients receiving flu vaccine (12.8% vs 40.9%,  p =0.002). Hospital admission due to ILI occurred for 10 patients (11% of ILI cases; 7 were unvaccinated). The ILI lethality was 2.2% (2 of 91 patients, both unvaccinated). Among vaccinated patients, those receiving adjuvated vaccines had lower incidence of ILI (4.8%  vs  9.9%,  p =0.046). Conclusions Flu vaccination was not effective for ILI prevention, nor for COVID-19. Nevertheless, it reduced ILI complications, with no ILI-related deaths in vaccinated patients. We recommend the vaccine in ICI-treated cancer patients. Clinical trial identification Eudract number of the trial: 2020-002603-18.

A large part of COVID-19 patients seem asymptomatic and cancer patients may be more vulnerable. We evaluated a screening strategy combining chest computed tomography (CT) and PCR for patients treated with radiotherapy (RT). Methods A screening strategy was organized from March 18, in our RT department. An inspiratory breath hold chest acquisition was proposed during the CT simulation for RT. Images was reviewed by a radiologist according to the CO-RADS classification. A nasal swab with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was proposed by the radiation oncologist in case of evocative imaging or clinical context. For patients who were already undergoing RT at this time, a PCR was proposed in case of evocative symptoms and before concomitant chemotherapy. Results From March 18 to May 1, 2020, 507 CT simulation were performed for 449 patients, including 445 chest acquisition. 237 of the chest CT (53%) showed lung abnormalities, of which 34 (8%) were COVID-19 compatible (CO-RADS \u2265 3). 102 patients were tested by PCR after the chest CT. 24 of the 449 (5.3%) patients were considered as COVID-19 patients: 19 had positive PCR, and five were considered positive on the basis of imaging despite PCR-negative PCR. Four of the patients (17%) were diagnosed during RT: 3 on routine screening before chemoradiotherapy, and one on symptoms. Four patients needed several PCR for the diagnosis of COVID-19 with six confirmed false negative PCR (Sensitivity (Se)= 76 % (19/25)). Three PCR positive patients had no evocative lung images (Se = 84%). During this period, an additional 169 patients whose CT simulation was prior to March 18, were also undergoing RT. Among them, six patients (3.6%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 by PCR during RT, performed for symptoms in 4 cases and on screening for the other 2. Of the 30 COVID-19 patients, only 8 (27%) had symptoms at the time of diagnosis. Twelve patients (40%) reported no symptoms and benefited from screening. Conclusions This study confirms the high proportion of asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 and suggests the value of screening by CT and PCR during COVID-19 pandemics.

In spite of a significant mortality rate, in the majority of cases the spectrum of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic to mildly symptomatic infection. No information is available on the prevalence and clinical impact of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection among actively treated cancer patients during pandemic. Methods From April 1 st , 2020 to the end of the month, 560 consecutive and unselected patients, scheduled for anticancer treatment at our facility and without clinical suspicious of COVID-19, were evaluated and tested for SARS-CoV-2. We implemented a two-step diagnostics, including a rapid serological immunoassay for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM and a pharyngeal swab RT-PCR assay in case of IgM seropositivity. Results In 560 patients, 172 (31%) resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibodies, regardless of type of cancer, stage and treatment. All IgM-seropositives were then tested with RT-PCR pharyngeal swabs and 55/146 (38%) proved to be SARS-CoV-2 carriers, with slightly difference b/w mildly symptomatic  vs.  asymptomatic patients (38  vs.  17). Therefore, the two-step procedure allowed the identification of 55 (10%) silent carriers in the whole study population and magnified the number needed to test (NNT) with the pharyngeal swab RT-PCR assay to detect a silent virus carrier (NNT: 2.6  vs.  10, with or without serological selection). At a very early follow up (8 wks), in 114 SARS-CoV-2-seropostive/RT-PCR-negative patients, who continued their anticancer therapies, none but one developed a symptomatic COVID-19 illness. Conclusions Among cancer patients, the two-step diagnostics strategy with serology followed by pharyngeal swab for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is feasible and effective and can help selecting cancer patients on treatment who might be silent carriers of the virus. The early safety outcome of patients previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2 supports the recommendation to continue active treatment, at least in the case of negative RT-PCR test.

This study aims to compare the outcomes of RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 positive disease in patients with or without a history of cancer. Methods We retrospectively collected clinical, pathological and radiological characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 RT-PCR positive cancer patients treated consecutively in 5 different North London hospitals (cohort A) and compared their outcomes to consecutively admitted COVID-19 positive patients without a history of cancer (cohort B). Patients were matched for age, gender and comorbidty and treated during the same time period (1st March- 30th April 2020). Results The median age in both cohorts was 74 years, with 67% male, and comprised of 30 patients with cancer, and 90 without (1:3 ratio). For cohort B, 579 patients without a history of cancer and consecutively admitted were screened from the primary London hospital, 105 were COVID-19 positive and 90 were matched and included. Excluding cancer, both cohorts had a median of 2 comorbidities. The odds ratio (OR) for mortality, comparing patients with cancer to those without, was 1.05 (95% CI 0.4-2.5), and severe outcome (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.4-2.0) suggesting no increased risk of death or a severe outcome in patients with cancer. Cancer patients who received systemic treatment within 28 days had an OR for mortality of 4.05 (95% CI 0.68-23.95), p=0.12. On presentation anaemia, hypokalaemia, hypoalbuminaemia and hypoproteinaemia were identified predominantly in cohort A. Median duration of admission was 8 days for cancer patients and 7 days for non-cancer. Conclusions Old age, late stage of cancer diagnosis and multiple co-morbidities adversely influence the outcome of patients with COVID-19 positive patients. These data do not demonstrate a higher risk to cancer patients compared to their non-cancer counterparts. If a second peak of pandemic strikes, a coordinated response of all overlapping specialities in the fight against cancer is required.

This conjecture has considerable impact on the treatment of cancer patients and large, multi-centre data to support this assumption is lacking due to the contingencies of the pandemic. Methods The cancer community of the United Kingdom (UK) has launched the UK Coronavirus Cancer Monitoring Project (UKCCMP). The UKCCMP is the first COVID-19 clinical registry that enables near real-time reports to frontline doctors about the effect of COVID-19 on cancer patients. Results An analysis of the first 800 cancer patients with symptomatic COVID-19 disease entered into the UKCCMP registry has been performed. Approximately half of these patients have a mild COVID-19 disease course (52%). Mortality was observed in 226 patients (28%) and risk of death was significantly associated with advancing patient age, sex (M>F) and the presence of other co-morbidities. Approximately one third had received cytotoxic chemotherapy within 4 weeks prior to testing positive for COVID-19. After adjusting for age, sex and comorbidities, recent receipt of chemotherapy had no significant effect on mortality from COVID-19 disease, when compared to cancer patients who had not received recent chemotherapy. No significant effect on mortality was also observed for patients with recent immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy or radiotherapy use. Conclusions Mortality from COVID-19 in cancer patients appears to be principally driven by age, sex and co-morbidities. We are not able to identify evidence that cancer patients on cytotoxic chemotherapy or other anti-cancer treatment are at significantly increased risk of mortality from COVID-19 disease compared to those not on active treatment.

Methods A 95 items survey was distributed worldwide by 20 oncologists from 10 of the most affected countries in order to evaluate the impact on organization of oncological care. Results 109 representatives from oncology centers in 18 countries (62.4% academic hospitals) filled out the survey (June 17 \u2013 July 14, 2020). A swab or gargle test is systematically performed before day care unit or overnight stay admissions in 27.5% and 58.7% of the centers, respectively. A local registry (64.2%) and systematic tracing (77.1%) of infected patients was organized in many centers. Treatment modalities mostly affected by the pandemic (cancellation/delay) were surgery (44.1%) and chemotherapy (25.7%). Earlier cessation of palliative treatment was observed in 32.1% of centers, and 64.2 % of participants agree that under-treatment is a major concern. At the pandemic peak, teleconsultations were performed for follow-up (94.5%), for oral therapy (92.7%), but also for patients receiving immunotherapy (57.8%) or chemotherapy (55%). Approximately 82% of participants estimate that they will continue to use telemedicine. Most participants reported more frequent use of virtual tumor boards (82%) and oncological team meetings (92%), but 45% disagree that virtual meetings are an acceptable alternative to live international meetings. Although 60.9% report reduced clinical activity during the pandemic peak, only 28.4% had an increased scientific activity. Only 18% of participants estimate that their well-being will not recover to previous levels by the end of the year; 63% indicate easily accessible psychological support for caregivers, but only 10% used or planned to use it. All clinical trial activities are or will soon be reactivated in 72.5% of the centers. Major study protocol violations/deviations were observed in 27.5% and significant reductions of clinical trial activities are expected by 37% of centers this year. Conclusions COVID-19 has a major impact on organization of patient care, well-being of caregivers, continued medical education and clinical trial activities in oncology.

Although anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG response is usually detectable within three weeks after infection, limited information on the seroconversion rate of patients with cancer infected by SARS-CoV-2 is available. Methods This is a multicenter, observational, prospective study that included patients and oncology healthcare workers (HCWs) with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR or clinical/radiological suspicious of infection as well as patients with cancer who are considered at high risk for infection. All subjects were tested with the 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassett for the fast detection of IgG and IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The aim of the study was to evaluate anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion rates by qualitative assay in patients with cancer and HCWs with confirmed or clinically suspected COVID-19. Results At first interim analysis, 166 subjects were enrolled in the study. Cancer patients and HCWs were 61 (36.7%) and 105 (63.3%), respectively. HCWs were younger than patients with cancer (median age 41 vs 62 years;  P <0.001). Eighty-six subjects (51.8%) had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis by RT-PCR testing on nasopharyngeal swab specimen, while forty-nine (29.5%) had a clinical suspicious of COVID-19 in absence of RT-PCR confirmation. In patients with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 62 (83.8%) were IgG-positive. Neither differences in terms of IgG positivity (87.9% vs 80.5%;  P =0.39) nor in median time from COVID-19 diagnosis to IgG detection (23.0 vs 28.0 days;  P =0.21) were found between patients with cancer and HCWs. Conclusions Our data show that SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody response is not different between cancer patients and healthy subjects. Qualitative rapid test for antibody detection represents an useful support to RNA RT-PCR testing for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in high-risk populations, including patients with cancer.

In this study we aimed to characterise the supportive care needs of hospitalised pts with C19, evaluate indications for specialist palliative care (SPC) referral and describe end of life (EOL) care for in-hospital decedents. Methods From the OnCOVID database (n=892) we analysed a subset of 191 pts hospitalised between 9/3 and 27/4/2020 in 9 centers from the UK (n=110, 57.5%), Spain (n=79, 41.5%) and Germany (n=2, 1%). Eligible pts were those with complete SPC referral data including EOL symptomatic burden. Results Of 191 eligible pts, 101 were male (52.9%) with mean age (\u00b1SD) of 68\u00b112 years. Most prevalent tumour sites were genito-urinary (n=41, 21.5%) and breast cancer (n=33, 17.3%), with non-metastatic disease (n=118, 63.7%). At C19 diagnosis, 96 pts (50.3%) were on active cancer therapy, 95 (49.7%) had >1 co-morbidity, most commonly hypertension (n=95, 49.7%) and diabetes (n=41, 21.5%). Median Australia-modified Karnofsky Performance Status (AKPS) score was 70 (IQR 30). In total, 114 pts received SPC input, mostly from hospital-based teams (n=98, 85.9%), for 9 (\u00b111) days before death or discharge for symptom control (n=101, 52.9%), psychological support (n=79, 41.4%) or advance care planning (n=78, 40.8%). In total 161 pts (84.3%) had evidence of a documented treatment escalation plan, with 84 (43.9%) having a valid DNACPR order. At database censoring, 72 pts had died (37.6%), 67 were prescribed anticipatory medications including opioids (n=51, 70.8%) and benzodiazepines (n=44, 61.1%). Amongst 64 in-hospital decedents, only 14 died in oncology wards (21.8%). Breathlessness (n=56, 87.5%), agitation (n=31, 48.4%) and confusion (n=23, 35.9%) were most common EOL symptoms. EOL symptomatic burden was not correlated with age, co-morbidities or AKPS at C19 diagnosis (p>0.05). Conclusions In the early phase of the C19 pandemic, the high in-hospital mortality from C19 in pts occurred mostly outside dedicated oncology inpatient areas. Complex palliative care needs and high EOL symptomatic burden of C19+ pts should inform SPC service planning in this population to optimise supportive and EOL care.

The pandemic determined a significant shrinkage of healthcare resources with difficulty for many patients (pts) to be assisted in the hospital, especially for the risk of being infected. We created a homecare project for cancer pts with the aim of reducing hospitalizations, accesses to the oncology ward and emergency room. Methods The team was composed by oncologists and nurses from the Oncology Unit of Cremona Hospital, supported by a secretary with a dedicated phone number. The assistance was provided from Mon to Sat, 9 AM-5 PM. Cancer pts were eligible if presenting confirmed diagnosis or suggestive symptoms for COV-19. A telephonic triage was performed. Cancer pts and their cohabitants were tested with at least 2 nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS). Blood test, medical examinations and vital parameters were performed. We advised screened individuals to follow the quarantine procedures, providing them with an information leaflet. We administered oral/infusional treatments, including antiviral drugs. Results From March 23rd to April 30th 2020, 71 cancer pts were assisted at home, with a total of 191 visits. Of the 71 pts tested with NPS, 26 resulted COV-19 positive (COV-19+). 19 of COV-19+ pts had mild symptoms; 7 pts with stable vital parameters and initial pneumonia were successfully treated at home with hydroxychloroquine, antivirals and NSAIDs. 7 pts with severe symptoms were promptly hospitalized. 4 of them died, 2 due to the infection, 2 to progression disease. 52 cohabitants were screened, 28 lived with a COV-19+ cancer patient; in this subgroup, 16 resulted COV-19+.15 of them were asymptomatic. Conclusions This project demonstrated the feasibility of an innovative model based on homecare assistance for COV-19+ cancer pts with mild symptoms. This strategy, limiting the number of hospital accesses for COV-19+ pts, might be useful to contain the spread of the infection. Further studies are needed to test this strategy in COV-19 negative cancer pts. Moreover, our experience indicates a high probability of identifying asymptomatic positive individuals. NPS screening for asymptomatic subjects is not routinely performed. There is a urgent need to extend the procedure to this population. Legal entity responsible for the study The authors.

The organization of cancer centers (CC) has been transformed to minimize virus exposure in cancer patients (pts). Real-time assessment of the impact on cancer outcomes can optimize decision-making for future epidemic episodes. Methods A discrete-event simulation (DES) model was developed to model individual pt pathways during the pandemic in a context of constrained medical resources. Cancer pt care is modeled based on pandemic-adapted guidelines for medical practice. Pt flow is derived from medico-administrative databases using time series methods to estimate the proportion of punctual / late visits and associated delay and to extrapolate future flows. Finally, the impact of modified care on survival is estimated using literature data. Results From March to December 2020, based on data from Gustave Roussy CC in France (n= 4877 included pts), estimated overall treatment delay is <= 7 days in 86,6% of pts and 5,2% of pts have a delay higher than 2 months. More than 94% of this duration is delay in pt request for care, causing 99 pts to suffer a major prognosis change upon arrival. Delayed pt flows result in a highly time-variable use of medical resources, with important queues forecast for surgery care and chemotherapy. The handling of such queues will require intensified healthcare professionals effort. Projections show that, in the best-case scenario, ie without a 2nd pandemic wave, treatment delays and modifications will result in around 49 additional 5-year cancer-specific deaths (+ 2,25% of 5-year deaths), mainly in liver, sarcomas and head and neck cancer pts. Conclusions In a resource-constrained context, optimization of the benefit-risk ratio between COVID-19 and cancer care is key. Simulations of individual projections from actual hospital data, show a 2.25% increase of the 5-year risk of death and that pandemic-related cancer burden is mainly due to patient-induced lateness in seeking care. Defining optimal strategies in terms of screening, monitoring and prioritization for care could minimize the impact of future pandemic episodes. Legal entity responsible for the study The authors.

In order to identify risk factors associated with a worse outcome of COVID-19, a nationwide registry was developed for patients with cancer and COVID-19. Methods This ongoing multicentre nationwide observational cohort study was designed as a quality of care registry and is executed by the Dutch Oncology COVID-19 Consortium (DOCC), a collaboration of oncology physicians in the Netherlands. A questionnaire was developed to collect pseudonymised patient data on patients\u2019 characteristics, cancer diagnosis, cancer treatment, and outcome of COVID-19. All patients with COVID-19 and a cancer diagnosis or cancer treatment in the past 5 years were eligible for inclusion. Results To date, > 600 cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19 have been registered by 45 Dutch hospitals. Data of 442 registered patients with at least 4 weeks follow-up were cleaned and 351 patients could be included for the first analyses. The main cancer diagnoses were non-small cell lung cancer (13.4%), breast cancer (13.4%), and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (8.8%). Overall, 114 (32.3%) out of 351 patients with cancer died from COVID-19. In multivariate analyses, age \u2265 65 years (p < 0.001), male gender (p = 0.035), prior or other malignancy (p = 0.045), and active diagnosis of haematological malignancy (p = 0.046) or lung cancer (p = 0.003) were independent risk factors for a fatal outcome of COVID-19. In a subgroup analysis of patients with active malignancy, the risk for a fatal outcome was mainly determined by tumour type (haematological malignancy or lung cancer) and age (\u2265 65 years). Conclusions The findings in this registry indicate that patients with a haematological malignancy or lung cancer have an increased risk of a worse outcome of COVID-19. During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, these vulnerable patients should avoid exposure to SARS-CoV-2, whereas treatment adjustments and prioritizing vaccination, when available, should also be considered.

This is one of few registries on the impact of COVID-19 in cancer patients in a country severly affected by the pandemic. Methods This cohort study is collecting data on symptomatic Sars-CoV-2 infected patients with a cancer diagnosis from 23 Swiss sites, starting March 1, 2020. The main objective of the study is to assess the outcome of COVID-19 infection in patients with solid and hematological malignancies, while the main secondary objective is to define prognostic factors of COVID-19 outcome. Results With a cutoff date of July 16, 2020, 357 patients with a diagnosis of cancer and symptomatic COVID-19 were included into this first analysis. The most frequent malignancies were breast in 63 cases (18%), lung in 40 cases (11%), prostate cancer in 24 cases (7%) and myeloma in 16 cases (5%), with 104 (38%) patients having non-curative disease. Anticancer treatment within 3 months prior to the diagnosis of COVID-19 included chemotherapy in 65 patients (18%), targeted therapy in 54 patients (15%), steroids in 39 (11%), checkpoint inhibitors in 22 (6%) or no anticancer treatment in 155 patients (43%). 230 patients (65%) were hospitalized for COVID-19 or were already in hospital; 167 of the hospitalized patients (73%) required oxygen treatment, 43 patients (19%) intensive care, 31 (14%) invasive ventilation. 63 patients died from COVID-19 infection, resulting in a mortality rate of 18%. Significant risk factors for death included age \u226565 versus <65 (HR 5.84, p<0.001) and non-curative versus curative disease (HR 2.34, p=.01). Neither male versus female gender (HR 1.59, p=0.12), type of cancer, geographic region, chemotherapy (HR 1.31, p=0.44), cardiovascular disease (HR 2.25, p=0.09) nor pulmonary comorbidity (HR 0.93, p=0.86) were significant risk factors for death. Conclusions We found a COVID-19 mortality rate in real-world cancer patients in a country with a decentralized, high-quality health care system that is substantially higher than in all COVID-19 infected patients in Switzerland (18% versus 5%). The rate of hospitalization and intensive care from COVID-19 in cancer patients is substantial. Legal entity responsible for the study Swiss Clinical Cancer Research Group.

Cancer patients (pts) consist of a highly vulnerable group due to underlying malignancy and/or treatment-induced immunosuppression. A high mortality rate from COVID-19 in cancer pts was previously reported. France is the fourth most affected country, with more than 150,000 infected individuals and over 28,000 deaths. GCO-002 CACOVID-19 study is a large French nationwide cohort of COVID-19 pts with solid tumors with the aim to identify risk factors of COVID-19 severity and evaluate impact on cancer treatment. Methods Bispective multicenter cohort set up by the French Cooperative Groups in solid cancers: ANOCEF-IGCNO (CNS tumors), ARCAGY-GINECO (gynecological and breast cancers), FFCD (digestive cancers), GERCOR (digestive and other solid cancers), GORTEC/intergroupe ORL (head and neck cancers (H&N), and IFCT (thoracic cancers). French pts with solid cancers and COVID-19 diagnosed since 1 March 2020 were accrued. Exclusion criteria: pts treated curatively > 5 years ago. Results From 6 April to 15 May 2020, 835 pts from 136 institutions (general hospitals 35%, university hospitals 35%, private centers 25%, cancer centers 5%) were registered. Men: 61%, median age: 69 years (20-100). Digestive cancers: 43% (16%/9% colorectal/pancreatic cancers), lung cancers: 22%, gynecological: 14%, (9% breast cancers), H&N: 10%, CNS: 4%, urologic cancers: 3%. Advanced or metastatic: 61%. Within 3 months before COVID-19 diagnosis, 69% of pts received a systemic anticancer treatment (chemotherapy, targeted or immune therapy) and 22% a local therapy (surgery, radiotherapy or local destruction). Diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by RT-PCR, CT-scan or both in 91% or serology in 1.4%. COVID was treated in the same oncological center in 78%. During the follow-up period (mean 14 days), 208 (25%) pts died, including 173 (21%) COVID-19 related deaths.

Here, we explore factors associated with overall survival (OS) and quality of life (QoL) benefit both at the time of initial approval and in the post-marketing period (PMP). Methods For trials supporting FDA cancer drug approvals between January 2006 and December 2015, we performed a systematic search of Pubmed and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify updated OS and/or QoL data, with follow-up through to April 2019. We explored variables associated with improvement in OS or QoL in the palliative setting using logistic regression. Results Among 96 trials, approval was based on improved OS in 41%. Among 59 trials providing updated efficacy data in the PMP, 47% showed improved OS; 39% for the first time. Improved OS at any time was observed in 52% of all trials. Only 47% of trials reported patient-reported outcomes (PRO) initially. Of these, 58% demonstrated a significant improvement in at least one PRO. Among 50% of trials which reported updated PRO data, improved QoL was observed in 46%; 50% for the first time. Improved QoL was observed in 38% of all trials. There were statistically significant associations between improved OS at initial approval and regular approval (OR 21.38; p=0.004), orphan drug designation (OR 0.39; p=0.04), sample size (OR 1.70; p<0.001), most prevalent tumors (OR 2.40; p=0.041), and crossover (OR 0.16; p=0.001). There was a non-significant association between improved QoL at initial approval and open-label studies (OR 3.85; p=0.053). Improved OS in the PMP was associated with immunotherapy (OR 8.20; p=0.026) and drugs with companion diagnostics (OR 11.67; p=0.006). Improved QoL in PMP was associated with sample size (OR 0.73; p=0.031), immunotherapy (OR 9.14; p=0.02) and open-label studies (OR 8.89; p=0.048). Conclusions Factors associated with OS and QoL benefit differs at the time of approval and in the PMP. Initially, drugs for prevalent tumors with regular approval are associated with OS benefit. In the PMP, immunotherapy and drugs with companion diagnostic tests are associated with improved OS. Legal entity responsible for the study The authors. Funding Has not received any funding.

Surrogate endpoints, such as progression-free survival or overall response rate, can provide misleading information about efficacy. However, for rare cancers, as outlined by Rare Cancers Europe (RCE), a campaign developed by ESMO, surrogate endpoints may be of value or even the only way to show improvements timely. Furthermore, the FDA and EMA introduced orphan drug designation to encourage drug development for rare conditions. We categorized pivotal trial endpoints for approved cancer drugs by the FDA and EMA (OS vs. OS surrogates) and evaluated the correlation with orphan drug designations by the FDA and EMA as well as rare cancers as defined by the RCE. Methods We identified new cancer drugs FDA-approved between 2009 and 2019 that were indicated to treat solid and hematologic tumors in adults and that had also been approved by the EMA by December 2019. Fisher\u2019s exact tests were conducted to assess the association between pivotal trial endpoints (OS vs. non-OS) and orphan drug designation by the FDA and EMA, as well as between pivotal trial endpoints and rare cancers as defined by RCE. Results 76 drugs were approved by the FDA and EMA during the study period. In the US, 39 (51%) were approved based on OS by contrast to 49 (64%) in the EU; 50 (66%) drugs were designated orphan status by the FDA, 17 (22%) by the EMA. There was an association between rare cancers as defined by the RCE and drug indications designated with orphan status by the FDA (p=0.007) or EMA (p<0.001). However, there was no association between pivotal trial endpoints (OS vs. non-OS) and orphan drug designation by the FDA (p=0.094) or EMA (p>0.9). There was also no association between rare cancers as defined by the RCE and pivotal trial endpoints (p=0.2 [US] and p=0.3 [EU]). Conclusions Approval of drugs for non-rare cancers should be better aligned with OS as pivotal trial endpoint. Since surrogate measures may not be adequately predictive of patient-centred outcomes, cancer drugs approved based on surrogate endpoints should be closely followed up also after approval to offer patients optimal value.

A systematic review and evaluation of 40 years of literature", "description": "Background The biopharmaceutical industry faces challenges related to its research & development (R&D) productivity. At the same time, some pricing policies for new products, particularly those concerning anticancer and orphan medicinal products, have been perceived as non-transparent or even outrageous, resulting in increased resistance by policy makers to reimburse them. In this context, a controversial theme has been the cost of bringing a new molecular entity (NME) to market. We reviewed, and critically assessed, the studies providing estimates of the pre-launch research & development (R&D) cost per NME. Methods A full systematic literature review of publications estimating the (pre-launch) R&D costs was conducted. 22 articles with 45 cost estimates were included (three focus on oncology and 16 include cancer alongside other therapeutic areas). We appraised their quality by evaluating 16 factors covering three domains: (1) how the drug samples, success rates, and development times used for cost estimation were obtained; (2) potential sources attributing to the variation in R&D costs; and (3) the cost components. Results Estimates of the total average capitalized R&D costs vary widely, from $161million to $4,539 million (2019 USD), with cancer drugs marking the top. We found evidence that the magnitude of these estimates has increased over time, but it is not related to study quality. In addition, average costs mask important differences, e.g. estimations suggested positive skewness for oncological drugs, with an average capitalized R&D cost between $944 and $4,539 million, while a median between $788 and $2,818 million (2019 USD). \u201cPotential sources of variation\u201d was the domain that shows the lowest quality scores. Conclusions Due to the heterogeneity of the methodologies and the variability (e.g., by therapeutic area) of the results, caution must be exercised when applying the estimated R&D cost averages. Given the variability of pre-launch drug R&D cost estimates, a standardized framework specifying the factors that ought to be considered in cost estimation seems warranted, and we propose one such here.

This study estimates the cost of cancer and access to medicines in Europe in 2018 and extends a previous analysis for 1995\u20132014. Methods Cancer-specific health expenditure for 31 countries (EU-27 plus Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, and the UK) were derived from national estimates. Data on cancer drug sales were obtained from IQVIA. Productivity loss from premature mortality was estimated from data from Eurostat and the WHO. Productivity loss from morbidity and informal care costs were estimated based on previous studies. Results The total cost of cancer was \u20ac199 billion in 2018. Total costs ranged from \u20ac160 per capita in Romania to \u20ac578 in Switzerland (after adjustment for price differentials). Health expenditure on cancer care were \u20ac103 billion, of which \u20ac32 billion were spent on cancer drugs. Informal care costs were \u20ac26 billion. The total productivity loss was \u20ac70 billion, composed of \u20ac50 billion from premature mortality and \u20ac20 billion from morbidity. Patient access to cancer medicines was much greater in wealthier than poorer countries in 2018, in terms of value and volume. The top spenders were Austria, Germany, and Switzerland (\u20ac92 to \u20ac108 per capita), whereas Czechia, Latvia, and Poland spent the least (\u20ac13 to \u20ac16). The largest country differences were seen in immuno-oncology medicines. Between 1995 and 2018, cancer incidence increased by 50% in Europe, but cancer mortality increased only by 20%. Health spending on cancer doubled from \u20ac52 billion to \u20ac103 billion (in 2018 prices and exchange rates), but the share of cancer care on the total health expenditure remained stable at around 4\u20137%. A shift from treatment in inpatient care to ambulatory care has likely saved costs. Expenditure on cancer medicines tripled from \u20ac10 billion to \u20ac32 billion between 2005 and 2018 (excluding confidential rebates). Productivity loss from premature mortality decreased over time, linked to mortality reductions in working-age patients. Conclusions There are large and persistent country differences in spending on cancer care, access to new cancer medicines and outcomes in Europe. Inequalities are mainly related to countries\u2019 economic strength and not to the disease burden of cancer.

As prices on cell therapies have skyrocketed over $350,000, there is now a consensus that cancer drugs\u2019 high prices may become a barrier to universal access to new cancer therapy, and to the sustainability of public health systems. High prices on new cancer drugs are linked to monopolies, misuse of patents and lack of public scrutiny regarding the quality of patents. This situation has hindered rational policy making. Patent oppositions have been recognized as one effective way to contest abusive monopolies. Used since 2005 by NGOs from the Global South in their fight against HIV/aids, this legal procedure has allowed for public scrutiny of patents, raised awareness on the weakness of health inventions patents, and strengthened patentability analysis standards. Following this path, in July 2019, M\u00e9decins du Monde and Public Eye questioned a Car-t treatment tisagenlecleucel patent at the European Patent Office (EPO) based on its lack of inventive step. Methods We have filed a patent opposition to the patent EP3214091. A patent opposition is a legal procedure for challenging the validity of a granted patent based on lack of novelty, inventive step and/or industrial application. As a result, the patent may be maintained, amended or revoked. When revoked, the legal effects associated with the patent are suspended, including monopoly rights. Results In November 2019, in response to our patent opposition, Novartis and the University of Pennsylvania requested revocation of the patent. In December 2019, the EPO revoked patent EP3214091. Our patent opposition was effective to scrutinize patent EP3214091. This result weakened tisagenlecteucel monopoly and produced a strong argument for public officers to demand fairer prices. Other patents are in force that still do not allow the production of biosimilar versions of tisagenlecleucel. Conclusions We have showed a method through which monopoly abuses on new cancer treatments can be regulated. A stronger mobilization of oncologists is necessary to prevent abusive monopolies in order to safeguard sustainable access to cancer treatments. Legal entity responsible for the study The authors.

In Europe, research on this topic has been largely neglected, arguably due to the belief that financial hardship for cancer patients is not a major concern in European social welfare states. The present study is the first attempt to measure, on the German national level, the magnitude of income loss after a cancer diagnosis. Methods This study analyzes data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) survey, one of the largest and most comprehensive household surveys in Germany, consisting of approximately 20,000 individuals, who are traced annually. The empirical strategy consists of OLS and multinomial logistic estimators to measure changes in job income, work status, working hours, and pension as a result of reporting a cancer diagnosis for the period between 2009 and 2015. Sample consistency checks were conducted to limit measurement error biases. Results Our empirical results show that job incomes dropped between 21% and 28% within the year a cancer diagnosis was reported. The effect persisted for two years after the diagnosis and was no longer observable in our data set after four years. The finding was linked to an increased likelihood of unemployment and a reduction of working hours by 24%. Pension levels, on the other hand, were not affected by a cancer diagnosis. Conclusions Our analysis suggests that many cancer patients are exposed to financial hardship in Germany, particularly when the cancer diagnosis occurs during their active life and before requirements to obtain a pension are met. Further research seems warranted to identify particularly vulnerable patient groups. Legal entity responsible for the study The authors. Funding Has not received any funding.

In pts with PDGFRA D842V-mutant GIST who received less than the 300 mg RP2D (n=17), an ORR of 82% was still achieved, with 2 (12%) CR and 12 (71%) PR. Most common adverse events (AEs, any grade) in \u226510% of pts with PDGFRA D842V-mutant GIST treated at 300/400 mg were nausea (74%), anaemia (68%), diarrhoea (66%), fatigue (58%), memory impairment (47%), periorbital oedema (45%), decreased appetite (39%), increased lacrimation (34%), and vomiting, abdominal pain, hypokalaemia, increased blood bilirubin and peripheral oedema (all 32%). A total of 21% of pts discontinued treatment due to drug-related AEs. There were no treatment-related deaths. Conclusions In pts with U/M PDGFRA D842V-mutant GIST, avapritinib has clinical activity with durable responses and a tolerable safety profile, with no additional safety signals to those found in the NAVIGATOR study overall GIST population.

In INVICTUS, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in \u22654 th -line advanced GIST, ripretinib compared with placebo (PBO) significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS, 6.3 vs. 1.0 months) reducing the risk of disease progression or death by 85% and showed a clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival (OS, 15.1 vs 6.6 months); data as of May 31, 2019 (ESMO 2019). Ripretinib is associated with a well-tolerated safety profile. Here, we report the updated results with an additional 9 months of follow-up. Methods Patients with advanced GIST previously treated with at least imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib were randomized (2:1) to ripretinib 150 mg QD or PBO. Upon disease progression determined by blinded independent central review (BICR), patients on PBO could cross over to ripretinib 150 mg QD. All patients who received 150 mg QD and progressed radiographically could receive 150 mg BID. Updated PFS by BICR, OS, and safety are reported here with data as of March 9, 2020. Results Overall, 129 patients were randomized and 128 received treatment (ripretinib 150 mg QD, n=85; PBO, n=43). Patients randomized to ripretinib had a median PFS (mPFS) of 6.3 (95% CI 4.6\u22128.1) vs. 1.0 (95% CI 0.9\u22121.7) months for patients on PBO with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.16. The median OS (mOS) in the ripretinib arm was not reached (95% CI 13.1\u2013NE) vs. 6.3 (95% CI 4.1\u221210.0) months in the PBO arm with a HR of 0.43. No new safety concerns emerged with longer exposure to ripretinib. Conclusions Evaluation of mPFS and OS in the phase III randomized INVICTUS trial, with a cut-off date for analysis approximately 9 months after the primary results, has shown an improvement in the mOS in the ripretinib arm from 15.1 months to not reached (95% CI 13.1\u2013NE) and a similar mPFS of 6.3 months in the ripretinib arm. These updated results confirm the clinically meaningful benefit in PFS and OS for ripretinib with a well-tolerated safety profile in patients with advanced GIST treated with at least 3 prior TKIs, including imatinib.

In the phase III study INVICTUS (NCT03353753), ripretinib significantly improved PFS vs placebo in patients (pts) with \u22654th-line GIST. Here, we report the phase I study (NCT02571036) IPDE experience in GIST pts across multiple lines of therapy. Methods In this dose-escalation and expansion phase I study, pts with 2 nd , 3 rd , and \u22654 th -line GIST were treated with ripretinib 150 mg QD. Investigator-assessed RECIST response assessments were performed every 2 cycles and pts with progressive disease (PD) could dose escalate to ripretinib 150 mg twice a day (BID). PFS period 1 (PFS1; 150 mg QD) was calculated from Cycle 1, Day 1 to PD; PFS2 (150 mg BID) from date of IPDE to 2 nd  PD or death. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were summarized by PFS1 and PFS2 onset periods and compared descriptively. Results In the phase I study, 142 GIST pts (2 nd  line, n=31; 3 rd  line, n=28; and \u22654 th  line, n=83) were enrolled in dose-escalation and expansion phases and received at least 1 dose of ripretinib 150 mg QD. In all lines, patients received additional benefit from ripretinib 150 mg BID (table; data as of Aug 31, 2019). TEAEs reported by the 64 pts in PFS1 and PFS2 periods were similar; the most common TEAEs (\u226510%) were alopecia, myalgia, nausea, fatigue, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, muscle spasms, rash, weight decreased, abdominal pain, diarrhea, back pain, vomiting and decreased appetite.

Systemic therapy can be considered in progressive cases or in symptomatic patients (pts). Regimens such as methotrexate-based schemes are usually administered for long periods. The aim of this phase II trial was to explore the activity of short-regimen of weekly nab-paclitaxel (nab-P) in DT. Methods Adult pts with clinically/radiologically progressive DT received 3 cycles of nab-P (125 or 240 mg/m2 days 1,8,15 every 28d in pts > 21y and 18-20 y, respectively). Primary combined end-point was overall response rate (ORR) by RECIST 1.1 and/or the proportion of pts with pain improvement in at least 2 points based on Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) scale. H0= ORR 20% or pain reduction 20%; H1= ORR 40% or pain reduction 40%. Central pathology and radiological review were mandatory. Results From May 2017 to September 2019, 40 pts were enrolled in 8 sites: 26F/14M, median age 38y (18-76), site (limbs 14/40; trunk wall 13/40, abdominal cavity 7/40, head and neck 6/40). Reason of inclusion: RECIST PD in 13/40 (32.5%), symptomatic progression (SP) in 12/40 (30%), both RECIST and pain in 15/40 (37.5%). All but 1 pts completed therapy (1 pt stopped due to allergic reaction after 1 cycle). ORR by RECIST (central review) was 20.5% (8/39 evaluable pts had PR; 30/39 (76.9%) SD (19/39 with shrinkage), 1/39 (2.5%) PD. Median worst pain at baseline was 6.5 (0-10) and median worst pain at the end of therapy was 2 (0-6), with a median reduction in 4 points (0-8). 32/40 (80%) pts experienced at least reduction in 2 points in worst pain. 4 pts had G3 toxicities (2-G3 neutropenia, 1 G3 mucositis,1 G3 peripheral neuropathy). There were no G4 toxic effects. With a median of FU of 18 mos, there were 2 PD, 6 SP and 2 both, PD and SP. Neck and proximal upper-extremity sites had worse 18m-PFS: 24% vs 86% in other locations (p< 0.001). Conclusions Short-regimen nab-paclitaxel was safe and active in this cohort of DT, with 80% of pts having clinical improvement and 20.5% achieving a radiological response. In patients with DT in neck or proximal upper extremity this regimen was related with less efficacy in terms of 18m-PFS. Clinical trial identification NCT03275818.

Two prospective trials with Pgp expression as stratification factor were activated in Italy and Spain. Methods Patients \u2264 40 years with extremity high-grade osteosarcoma were eligible. Pgp expression was centralized. Preoperatively, all patients received MAP (methotrexate, adriamycin, platinum). In case of Pgp overexpression (Pgp+), mifamurtide (2 mg/m2 twice/week for 3 months than weekly for 6 months) was added after surgery, with 4 consecutive cycles of ifosfamide 3 gr/m2/day, day 1-5 (HDIFO) in case of poor response (PR) to MAP. Patients without overexpression of Pgp (Pgp-) received MAP postoperatively, regardless the pathological response. From March 2013, an amendment increased high dose methotrexate (HDMTX) cumulative dose from 60 g/m2 (5 cycles) to 120 mg/m2 (10 cycles). In the same period, this regimen was adopted in an observational prospective study performed by the Spanish Sarcoma Group (GEIS) (NCT04383288). Results From June 2011 to March 2018, 291 ISG patients were screened and 279 were included: 110 were Pgp-, 154 were Pgp+, while in 15 patients Pgp expression was not evaluable. With a median follow-up of 58 months (range 1.2 \u2013 102.2), the 3-year EFS and OS were 65.5% (95% CI 59.4-70.9) and 85.8% (95% CI 81-89.6), respectively, with improved survival after 10 HDMTX cycles (table).

In this setting, patient values and preferences -though understudied- are central to treatment decisions. Our objectives were to explore priorities for quality versus quantity (length) of life (QoL vs. LoL) and treatment expectations in patients starting chemotherapy (CTx). Methods The HOLISTIC study is an international prospective cohort study assessing health-related quality of life in advanced STS patients receiving palliative CTx. Participants completed a baseline questionnaire before starting 1 st -line CTx, including treatment expectations and preferences for QoL vs. LoL. Chi-squared and Fisher\u2019s exact tests were used to evaluate associations between patient characteristics, preferences and expectations. Results In total, 137 patients with advanced STS participated (U.K: n=72, Netherlands: n=65). Median age was 62 years (range 27-79). Preference for extended LoL (48%) was slightly more common than preference for QoL (41%); 9% valued LoL and QoL equally. Younger patients (aged<40 years;  P =0.002) and those who were employed ( P =0.019) prioritised LoL. U.K participants and those with dependent children tended to prioritise LoL, however, this trend was not statistically significant. Most patients thought that CTx would help them to live longer (88%), 27% believed CTx was potentially curative and 67% thought that it would improve cancer-related problems. Belief that treatment could be curative was more common among \u2018non-Caucasian\u2019 participants (n=22;  P =0.016). Gender, marital status, education level, performance status, baseline health-related quality of life, disease extent and time period since advanced STS diagnosis were not associated with preferences or expectations. Conclusions These data show heterogenous preferences and expectations among advanced STS patients starting 1 st  line chemotherapy, supporting personalised decision making. Treatment regret will be a topic of further study. Clinical trial identification NCT03621332.

Methods 18 sarcoma reference centres contributed data. Patients with advanced EHE diagnosed 2000 onwords, treated with systemic therapies, were selected. Local pathological review and molecular confirmation was required. Radiological response was retrospectively assessed by local investigators according to RECIST. Progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated by Kaplan Meier method. Results 72 patients were included (characteristics in the table), 21 had more than one treatment. 33 patients received anthracycline-based regimens, achieving 1 (3%) partial response (PR), 25 (76%) stable disease (SD, 14 with prior PD), 7 (21%) progressive disease (PD). The median (m-) PFS and m-OS were 5 and 14 months respectively. 11 patients received weekly paclitaxel, achieving 1 (9%) PR, 6 (55%, 2 with prior PD) SD, 4 (36%) PD. The m-PFS and m-OS were 3 and 19 months respectively. 12 patients received pazopanib, achieving 3 (25%, 2 with prior PD) SD, 9 (75%) PD.

EJC 2002). These have been widely used since then. We aim to provide an update focusing on LMS. Methods CTs involving advanced or metastatic LMS were identified by literature review (published 2003-2018, \u2265 10 LMS patients). Endpoints of interest were 3- and 6-month PFS. When estimates could not be derived from the publication, data requests were sent out. Treatments (trt) were classified as recommended (R-T) or non-recommended (NR-T) according to the ESMO 2018 guideline. A random effects model was employed to pool trial-specific estimates and obtain overall PFS at 3 and 6 months for first line (1L) and pre-treated (2L+) patients separately. The ESMO Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (ESMO-MCBS) was used to guide the choice of trt effect to target in future trials. Results From 32 studies identified, we obtained information so far on 6 1L and 14 2L+ trials. Overall, for 1L, PFS at 3 and 6 months were 78% (95%CI 74-82) and 64% (95%CI 59-68), respectively. No difference was observed between R-T and NR-T due to considerable trial heterogeneity. For 2L+ patients, overall 3-month PFS was 50% (95%CI 44-56 \u2013 differences not significant between R-T and NR-T due to trial heterogeneity), and 37% (95%CI 29-44%) / 24% (95%CI 18-30) at 6 months for R/NR-T. Data collection continues. The ESMO-MCBS recommends a HR of at least 0.65 for PFS. The table below summarizes what this translates to for the null hypothesis (H0) and alternative hypothesis (H1) of a study assuming an exponential PFS curve.

With the lack of prospective data on anthracycline-based CT in advanced WD/DD LPS, we conducted a retrospective analysis of the activity of cytotoxic regimens in patients (pts) with LPS of intrabdominal origin (IA-LPS) who had entered EORTC/STBSG clinical studies, assuming that the vast majority of LPS at this location are WD/DD LPS. Methods We searched for all adult pts treated with first-line CT for advanced IA-LPS in EORTC/STBSG phase II-III trials from 1970. Treatment was aggregated into 5 groups: anthracycline (A) alone (Doxorubicin (D) 75 mg/m 2 , Caelyx 50 mg/m 2 , Epirubicin 75 mg/m 2 , Epirubicin 150 mg/m 2 ), Ifosfamide (IFO) alone (IFO 5 g/m 2 , IFO 9 g/m 2 , IFO 12 g/m 2 ), D+IFO (D 50 mg/m 2 +IFO 5 g/m 2 , D 75 mg/m 2+ IFO 5 g/m 2 , DOX 75 mg/m 2 +IFO 10 g/m 2 ), D+cyclophosphamide+vincristine+DTIC (CYVADIC), \u201cother\u201d (brostallicin, trabectedin). Response was assessed by RECIST or WHO criteria. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were computed by Kaplan-Meier method.

At 10-mo median follow-up (IQR 6-24), m-OS was 19 mos (95%CI 15-21), m-PFS 4 mos (95%CI 3-6). D+IFO achieved a not statistically significant longer m-PFS (12 mos) and m-OS (31 mos) than observed with other regimens. Univariate and multivariate analysis of response to CT did not identify prognostic factors. Conclusions Cytotoxic CT, in particular D alone, had limited activity in advanced IA-LPS. Though IFO-containing regimens showed higher activity compared to A alone in a small number of cases. This series provides a benchmark for future trials on new drugs in WD/DD LPS.

ORIENT-12, a randomized, double-blind, phase III study, compared the efficacy and safety of sintilimab plus GP with placebo plus GP as 1L treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic sqNSCLC (NCT03629925). Methods Patients with histologically/cytologically confirmed stage IIIB/C (ineligible for concurrent chemoradiation or surgery) and stage IV sqNSCLC were enrolled and randomized 1:1 to receive either sintilimab (S group) or placebo (P group) with GP every 3 weeks for 4 or 6 cycles, followed by sintilimab or placebo as maintenance therapy. Stratification factors included disease stage (IIIB/C vs IV), platinum (cisplatin vs. carboplatin), PD-L1 expression (TPS, \u22651% vs <1%). Conditional crossover was allowed. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by Independent Radiographic Review Committee (IRRC) per RECIST v1.1. Results A total of 357 pts were enrolled and randomized to S group (n=179) and P group (n=178). At interim analysis (median follow-up 8.0 mon), mPFS (by IRRC) was 5.1 mo in S group vs 4.9 mo in P group (HR, 0.621; 95% CI 0.473 - 0.815; P=0.00056). mPFS benefit was also observed by investigator assessment (5.9 mo vs. 4.9 mo, HR, 0.575; 95%CI 0.435 - 0.761; P=0.00009). The mOS was not reached in both groups, but showed a nominally significant improvement favoring S group (HR, 0.567, 95%CI, 0.353 to 0.909, P=0.01701). The PFS benefit with sintilimab plus GP was observed in all PD-L1 subgroups. The incidence of grade \u22653 adverse events was similar between groups (86.6% vs 83.1%). No new safety signals were observed. Conclusions ORIENT-12 is the first study globally to demonstrate superiority of an anti-PD-1 antibody plus GP over GP in PFS and OS with acceptable safety profile as 1L treatment for locally advanced or metastatic sqNSCLC.

However, predictive biomarkers for this immuno-combination remain to be elucidated. Methods In a randomized, double-blind, phase III study evaluating the efficacy of sintilimab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, plus pemetrexed and platinum (Chemo) as first-line treatment (ORIENT-11), 397 patients with locally advanced or metastatic nsq-NSCLC were randomized (2:1 ratio) to receive either sintilimab plus Chemo (Combo) or placebo plus Chemo. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). RNA sequencing was conducted on 248 baseline tumor biopsies (168 in Combo and 80 in Chemo). Results Combo group showed superiority to Chemo group in PFS (HR=0.48, 95%CI: 0.36-0.64, p<0.0001). Survival analysis showed that top 20 genes (Ranked by P-value) including ITGB2, ADAP2, MPP1, PIK3AP1, GBGT1, RAB27A, CD180, NEK6, RLN3, CD84, CASP8, DRAM1, HLA-DMB, OTULIN, HELZ, VDR, HLA-DPA1, MX2, FUCA1, MKRN1 were significantly associated with good efficacy of Combo treatment (mean HR 0.26, P<0.0001) but not Chemo treatment except for NEK6 (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.14\u22120.50; P=0.0047). In line with this, we found that the entire signature score of MHC-II antigen presentation pathway was more significantly associated with clinical efficacy of Combo (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.28-0.91; P=0.0230) than that of MHC-I (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.39\u22121.25; P=0.2230). It was further validated that cells with MHC-II presentation capability also contributed to the longer PFS in the Combo group, e.g. macrophage (HR, 0.48; P=0.0120), activated dendritic cell (HR, 0.46; P=0.0114), immature dendritic cell (HR, 0.47; P=0.0134), or immature B cell (HR, 0.51; P=0.0245). Finally, multiplex immunohistochemistry data from 57 patients demonstrated concordance between RNA and protein expression and that higher level of CD68 protein was associated with good outcome (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.12-1.54; P=0.1930). Conclusions Signature of MHC-II antigen presentation was significantly associated with longer PFS in patients receiving immune-combination therapy and could be served as a predictive biomarker.

ATALANTE-1 was a randomized, open-label, 2-Step phase 3 study comparing the efficacy of Tedopi\u00ae with standard treatment (SoC) in HLA-A2+ NSCLC patients in 2 nd  or 3 rd  line treatment after progression on ICI. Methods HLA-A2+ NSCLC patients,  EGFR  and  ALK  negative, having progressed to platinum-based chemotherapy (CT) and anti-PD(L)1, ECOG PS 0-1 were randomized 2:1 to receive Tedopi\u00ae subcutaneously Q3W for 6 cycles, followed by maintenance Q8W up to first year, then Q12W, or SoC (docetaxel 75 mg/m 2  Q3W or pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2  Q3W). The Step-1 hypotheses were based on the evaluation of 1y-OS rate (Fleming design: H0 futility boundary at 25%; H1 alternative efficacy: 40% of OS rate at 12 months). Step-2 was a superiority study with OS as primary endpoint. Results At cutoff of February 2020, 99 patients (Tedopi\u00ae n=63; SoC n=36) were randomized and analyzable for Step-1. The 1y-OS was 29/63 (46%) [95%CI 33-59]) in Tedopi\u00ae group and 13/36 (36%) [95%CI 21-54] in SoC. The Step-1 endpoint has shown a lower limit of the 95% confidence interval above the futility boundary (25%) with an OS estimate of 10% above the estimate of SoC. Secondary endpoints and subgroup data will be further presented. Grade 3-4 related TEAEs were 11 % in Tedopi\u00ae group and 43 % in SoC. There was no related grade 5 TEAE. Related TEAE leading to withdrawal from the study were also less frequent in Tedopi\u00ae group (6%) versus SoC (14%). Due to the risk of COVID-19 pandemic on data integrity, following recommendation of the Independent Data Monitoring Committee and Steering Committee, the decision was taken to early terminate the study at Step-1 and definitely stop new accrual while continuing the OS follow-up in all patients. Conclusions The Step-1 primary endpoint was positively achieved with a 1y-OS rate of 46% and a good safety profile. Step-1 results shown a favorable benefit/risk of Tedopi\u00ae over SoC as 2nd or 3rd line treatment in advanced HLA-A2+ NSCLC patients after failure to ICI.

Methods From 02/17-12/19, 101 patients with stage IV non-squamous NSCLC in 2 nd -line or 3 rd -line treatment were enrolled in this multicentre, prospective, non-randomized phase II trial. 41 patients with a clinical indication for palliative radiotherapy received nivolumab 240 mg followed by 5 x 4 Gy on consecutive days to metastasis (53% bone, 18% lymph node, 29% other), initiated 72 hours after first nivolumab administration (Group A). 60 patients without an indication for radiotherapy received nivolumab only (Group B). Nivolumab was administered every two weeks in both groups and continued until progression or limiting toxicities. In both groups, biomaterials were collected systematically for exploratory hypothesis-generating analyses. Results Whilst some patient baseline characteristics, e.g. age, gender, smoking status and number of previous therapies were similar in both groups, preliminary analyses indicate an imbalance with a number of unfavourable characteristics being more prevalent in group A (e.g. ECOG 1, 81% vs 58%; extrathoracic metastases, 93% vs. 63%; p<0.05). Treatment related grade 3-4 adverse events occurred at similar rates in both groups (17% vs. 15%, p=0.8). The primary objective was to achieve an objective response rate (ORR) of > 19% per RECIST criteria 1.1 in group A. With an ORR of 8.3% in group A, this target was not met (p=0.991 for one-sided binomial test). ORR in group B was 23.8%. Patients with missing tumor response assessment due to tumor-related death (group A and B: 8 and 5) were considered non-responders.  Conclusions The combination of nivolumab and palliative radiotherapy was safe and feasible; however, it did not improve ORR in the setting of this exploration. The requirement for a clinical indication for palliative radiotherapy enforced selection of patients with unfavourable properties into group A. Clinical characteristics need consideration when assessing the efficacy of immunotherapy. Clinical trial identification EudraCT Nr.: 2015-005741-3; NCT03044626.

We present PROs from the study. Methods PROs were exploratory endpoints; disease-related symptoms were evaluated using the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale average symptom burden index and 3-item global index (LCSS ASBI/3-IGI); health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was evaluated using EQ-5D-3L visual analog scale and utility index (EQ-5D-3L VAS/UI). Analyses included mean changes from baseline, mixed-effect model repeated measures (MMRM) of longitudinal changes, and time to deterioration. Results PRO completion rates were > 80% across arms for most on-treatment assessment time points in which there were \u2265 10 pts (up to week 90 for NIVO + IPI + chemo and week 78 for chemo). A trend for improvement in LCSS ASBI and 3-IGI was seen in both treatment arms, though the minimally important difference was not reached. In both arms, mean EQ-5D-3L VAS scores approached UK population norms after \u223c30 weeks. MMRM analyses showed similar improvement across arms in overall LCSS ASBI when there was a sufficient number of patients in both study arms for assessment (up to week 78). There was a decreased risk of, and delayed time to, definitive deterioration with NIVO + IPI + chemo vs chemo (Table). Conclusions Pts with advanced NSCLC treated with NIVO + IPI + chemo (2 cycles) maintained their quality of life as compared with chemo (4 cycles). Pts in the NIVO + IPI + chemo arm had decreased risk of definitive deterioration in HRQoL and symptoms vs chemo.

We are evaluating the efficacy and safety of poziotinib, a potent EGFR and HER2 exon 20 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), in a large, prospective multi-cohort study (N=603). Here, we report results from a cohort of previously treated patients with advanced NSCLC exon 20 insertion mutations (ZENITH20-2 N=90). Methods Patients enrolled in ZENITH20-2 had HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations per a CLIA certified (or equivalent) sequencing test. Poziotinib (16 mg) was administered orally QD, allowing dose interruptions/reductions for toxicity if needed. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR), evaluated centrally by an independent image review committee using RECIST 1.1 with a 95% CI pre-specified lower bound of 17%. Secondary endpoints included disease control rate, duration of response, progression-free survival, and safety. Results In ZENITH20-2 , 90  patients were enrolled with a median age of 60 years; 64% females, 66% non-smokers, 78% Caucasians, and 16% had concurrent clinically stable brain metastases at entry. Median number of prior therapies was 2 (range: 1-6), with 98% of patients having prior chemo/platinum-based therapy; 67% immunotherapy, including checkpoint inhibitors; and 28% HER2 therapy. The most common treatment-related Grade \u22653 AEs were rash (30%), diarrhea (26%), and mucosal inflammation (14%). ORR in 74 evaluable patients was 35.1% (95% CI: 24.4 \u2013 47.1%) and 27.8% (95% CI: 18.9 \u2013 38.2%) in all 90 patients (As-Treated Population). The 95% CI lower bound exceeded the protocol-specified threshold of 17%. Median DoR was 5.1 months (range: 1-12.3+ months) with 3 patients continuing on treatment. DCR was 70% and median PFS was 5.5 months (range: 0.03-13.1+ months). Responses were observed in most subgroups. Specifically, ORR was 38.7% in 31 patients with 3+ lines of therapy and 28.6% in 14 patients with CNS metastasis. Conclusions ZENITH20-2 met its ORR primary efficacy endpoint with durable responses and presented a manageable safety profile, typical of 2 nd  generation TKIs. Additional cohorts are enrolling to explore alternative dose levels and BID dosing. Clinical trial identification NCT03318939. Legal entity responsible for the study Spectrum Pharmaceuticals.

Tarloxotinib has shown preclinical efficacy in  EGFR  exon 20 and  HER2  mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as well as other oncogenic alterations in the  ERBB  gene family such as  NRG1  fusions. We report the first results of the RAIN-701 trial (NCT03805841). Methods Patients (pts) with advanced NSCLC harboring an  EGFR  Exon 20 insertion (Cohort A) or  HER2  activating mutation (Cohort B) with progressive disease after platinum-based chemotherapy or with any solid tumors harboring an  NRG1 ,  EGFR ,  HER2  or  HER4  fusion (cohort C) were eligible. Enrollment was based on local genomic testing. Tarloxotinib was administered at 150 mg/m 2  IV weekly. The primary endpoint is objective response rate per RECIST v1.1. Results As of June 12, 2020, 23 pts (11 cohort A, 11 cohort B, 1 cohort C) were treated with tarloxotinib. The disease control rate for all evaluable pts was 60% (12/20). In cohort A, the best response was stable disease (SD) in 6/11 (55%) and progressive disease (PD) in 5/11 (45%). In cohort B, 4/9 evaluable pts (44%) exhibited tumor reduction by RECIST and 2/9 pts experienced confirmed PR (22%), 4/9 (44%) pts had SD, and 3/9 (33%) pts had PD. Three pts in cohort B were treated beyond 6 months with 3 pts still ongoing. Most treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were grade 1/2. Those occurring at >20% were prolonged QTc (60.9%), rash (43.5%), nausea (21.7%), and diarrhea (21.7%). The grade 3 TEAEs were prolonged QTc (34.8%), rash (4.3%), diarrhea (4.3%) and increased ALT (4.3%). Five of 23 (21.7%) pts required dose reduction and only 1/23 (4.3%) pts discontinued tarloxotinib due to a drug-related adverse event (infusion reaction). Conclusions Tarloxotinib exhibits antitumor activity in NSCLC pts with  HER2  activating mutations. Tarloxotinib was well tolerated and exhibited low rates of severe EGFR-related toxicities such as rash and diarrhea. Clinical trial identification NCT03805841.

Currently approved EGFR TKIs have not shown efficacy in most of these mutations. Mobocertinib is an investigational oral EGFR/HER2 inhibitor under evaluation in pts with metastatic NSCLC with  EGFR  exon20ins. We previously reported dose escalation and establishment of 160 mg qd as RP2D. We report updated antitumor activity and safety results from an open-label, multicenter study of mobocertinib (NCT02716116). Methods Antitumor activity by investigator-assessed radiographic response (RECIST 1.1) and toxicity (NCI CTCAE) were determined for pts with advanced, previously treated NSCLC with  EGFR  exon20ins who received mobocertinib 160 mg qd. Safety data were collected for all pts treated at 160 mg qd. Results As of 27 Jan 2020, 28 pts with previously treated NSCLC and  EGFR  exon20ins were treated in dose escalation/expansion at 160 mg qd. In these pts: median age, 62 y (range 28\u2012 84); women, 75%; ECOG 0/1, 21%/79%; \u22652 prior anticancer therapies, 86%; brain metastases, 43%. Median time on treatment was 12 mo (13 treatment cycles) and 7 pts remain on treatment. Confirmed ORR (PR) was 43% (12/28; 95% CI 24\u201263). The disease control rate was 86% (24/28; 95% CI 67\u201396). Two pts had best response of PD; 2 pts were not evaluable. Median duration of response in the 12 pts with confirmed PR was 14 mo (95% CI 5\u2013not reached). The median PFS was 7.3 mo (95% CI 4.4\u201215.6); 12-mo PFS was 33% (15\u201252). Response to mobocertinib was observed in diverse  EGFR  exon20ins variants. Among these 28 pts, most common any grade treatment-related AEs (TRAEs; >25%) as assessed by investigator: diarrhea (82%), rash (46%), nausea (39%), decreased appetite (39%), vomiting (36%), paronychia (29%); grade \u22653 TRAEs (\u22655%): diarrhea (32%), nausea (11%), increased lipase (7%), increased amylase (7%), stomatitis (7%), vomiting (7%). In all 136 pts treated with \u22651 dose of 160 mg, most common TRAEs: diarrhea (83%), nausea (43%), rash (33%), vomiting (27%); grade \u22653 TRAEs: diarrhea (21%) and increased lipase (5%). Conclusions Mobocertinib demonstrated antitumor activity in pts with advanced NSCLC with  EGFR  exon20ins. The safety profile for mobocertinib was consistent with other EGFR TKIs.

We report safety and activity in such pts treated in a phase I study (NCT03260491) with patritumab deruxtecan, a HER3 directed antibody drug conjugate, at the 5.6 mg/kg recommended dose for expansion. Methods The dose escalation part was presented previously. The dose expansion part enrolled pts with  EGFR m NSCLC with prior EGFR TKI and platinum-based chemotherapy. Primary objective is assessment of activity by confirmed ORR (blinded independent central review, BICR); secondary objectives include evaluation of safety. Patritumab deruxtecan was administered IV Q3W. Results As of 30 April 2020, 57 pts from dose escalation and dose expansion were treated at the 5.6 mg/kg dose, and 56 pts were evaluable for response. Among 28 pts continuing treatment at data cutoff, 6 had only 1 tumor evaluation. Median prior anticancer regimens for metastatic disease was 4 (range, 1-9); 51 pts [90%] received prior platinum. Median number of prior EGFR TKIs was 2 (range, 1-4); 49 pts [86%] received prior osimertinib. 27 pts (47%) had history of central nervous system metastases. Median treatment duration was 3.5 mo (range, 1-14 mo); median follow up was 5.4 mo (range, 0.3-15 mo). The most common grade \u22653 treatment-emergent adverse events were platelet count decrease (25%) and neutrophil count decrease (16%). Efficacy for the 56 efficacy-evaluable pts is shown below; 3 additional pts had PR awaiting confirmation. HER3 was expressed in nearly all tumors. Efficacy was observed in pts with various mechanisms of EGFR TKI resistance, including  EGFR  C797S,  MET  amp,  HER2 m,  BRAF  fusion, and  PIK3CA m. Conclusions Patritumab deruxtecan at 5.6 mg/kg provides promising evidence of preliminary antitumor activity and safety in heavily pretreated pts with locally advanced or metastatic  EGFR m NSCLC.

We evaluated the benefit of first-line pembrolizumab (P) combined with Pl-E from cycle 3 in the subgroup of chemo-sensitive ED-SCLC. Methods REACTION is a multicenter, open-label, randomized phase II trial. Patients with ED-SCLC, unselected for PD-L1, with PS 0/1 and controlled brain metastases who achieved an objective response after 2 X Pl-E were randomized 1:1 to experimental arm (EXP) P in combination with 4 X Pl-E then P up to 35 cycles vs. 4 X Pl-E in the control (CTRL) arm. Cross-over to P-Pl-E was allowed for CTRL. Primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS) from randomization. With a 1-sided alpha 10%, the study was powered at 90% level to detect a Hazard Ratio (HR) of 0.575 in PFS. Results Between Feb 7, 2018 and Oct 31, 2019, 125 patients were recruited (61 in EXP arm vs 64 in CTRL arm) with 119 (58 vs 61) eligible and receiving at least one dose of treatment (Per Protocol [PP] population). Median age was 65 vs 63.5 years with the majority being male (72 vs 56%), PS 1 (62 vs 60%), and rare brain metastases (8 vs 11%). Most patients had partial response (PR) to the induction chemo (98% in each arm). 19 patients crossed over to P-E-Pl. Among 124 patients who started treatment, grade \u22653 adverse events were observed in 43 vs 36%, while only 2 patients (1 in each arm) had grade 5 toxicity. Among PP patients, 107 PD or deaths were observed. The response rate was 61% (67 vs 56%). Median follow-up time with respect to OS was 14.2 months in EXP and 14.0 months in CTRL arm. Median PFS (80% CI) was 4.7 months (4.5, 5.3) vs 5.4 (4.9, 5.5), HR = 0.84 (0.65, 1.09) and 1-sided p=0.194. Median OS (80% CI) was 12.3 months (10.2, 14.5) vs 10.4 (8.5, 11.6), HR = 0.73 (0.54, 1.0) and 1-sided p=0.097. Conclusions P combined with Pl-E was well tolerated but did not improve PFS over Pl-E in chemo-sensitive patients with ED-SCLC. The OS however showed P combined with Pl-E significantly improved OS at 1-sided 10% level. Clinical trial identification NCT02580994. Legal entity responsible for the study EORTC. Funding MSD.

Landmark analyses indicated 22% of pts were alive at 24m with the addition of D\u00b1T to EP. Here we assess the clinical characteristics and outcomes of pts deriving long-term benefit, as well as the relationship between TMB and efficacy outcomes in the ITT population. Methods 805 pts with ES-SCLC were randomised 1:1:1 to D+EP, D+T+EP, or EP. Exploratory subgroup analyses defined long-term clinical benefit as PFS \u226512m. Tumour tissue was mandated at screening, if available. TMB was assessed in tissue (tTMB) using the FoundationOne CDx platform. Results 45 (17%), 42 (16%), and 12 (5%) pts treated with D+EP, D+T+EP, and EP had PFS \u226512m, respectively (data cutoff 27 Jan 2020). In all arms, the PFS \u226512m subgroup had a higher incidence of favorable prognostic factors (more women and pts with PS 0, fewer pts with brain/liver metastases). In the D+EP arm, pts with PFS \u226512m received more D (median 25 vs 7 cycles) and had improved ORR (96% vs 63%), median DoR (NR vs 4m) and OS at 24m (77% vs 11%) compared with the PFS <12m subgroup (Table). Similar results were observed with EP and when both IO arms were combined. Safety and additional efficacy outcomes in the subgroups will be presented. Across all 3 arms, 283 pts (35% of ITT) were evaluable for tTMB. tTMB was not predictive of a differential treatment effect for D\u00b1T+EP vs EP (OS, PFS, or ORR).

OS benefit persists with longer follow-up. Here, we report exploratory analyses of long-term survivors (LTS) in IMpower133. Methods Eligible patients (pts) with tx-naive ES-SCLC received four 21-day cycles of C (AUC 5 mg \u2022 mL/min IV, day 1) + E (100 mg/m 2  IV, days 1-3) with either atezo (1200 mg IV, day 1) or PBO, followed by maintenance tx with atezo or PBO until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression or loss of clinical benefit. Co-primary endpoints were investigator-assessed PFS and OS. This exploratory analysis included characterisation of LTS, defined as pts who survived \u2265 18 mo post randomisation; pts who died < 18 mo post randomisation were defined as non-LTS. Pts who were censored at < 18 mo were excluded. Association of LTS with pt and disease characteristics was explored. Results At data cutoff (24 Jan 2019), median follow-up in the ITT population was 22.9 mo; 373 pts were included in this exploratory analysis. There were more LTS in the atezo + CE arm (n = 61, 33.5%; 95% CI: 26.7, 40.9) than in the PBO + CE arm (n = 39, 20.4%; 95% CI: 14.9, 26.8). Among LTS, baseline categories with a > 5% difference between tx arms included age, sex, ECOG PS, LDH and brain metastases (Table). Median SLD was lower in the LTS vs the non-LTS group. Biomarker status (bTMB; PD-L1) did not appear to be associated with long-term survival benefit.

We present patient-reported outcomes (PROs) from KEYNOTE-604. Methods 453 patients (pts) were randomized 1:1 to pembro 200 mg Q3W or saline placebo for \u226435 cycles plus 4 cycles of standard-dose EP. PRO questionnaires, including the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13, were administered electronically before other trial-related procedures at cycles 1-9, 11, 13, 15, and 17, treatment discontinuation, and the 30-day safety follow-up. Mean change from baseline to wk 18 in the QLQ-C30 global health status (GHS)/QoL scale and time to true deterioration (TTD) in the QLQ-C30/LC13 composite of cough, chest pain, or dyspnea were secondary study end points; TTD in the QLQ-C30 GHS/QoL scale was a protocol-specified exploratory end point. TTD was defined as time to first \u226510-point worsening from baseline with confirmation under a right-censoring rule. HRQoL was assessed in all treated pts who completed \u22651 PRO assessment (N = 439).  P  values are nominal and two-sided. Results PRO compliance was \u226589% in both arms at baseline and wk 18. Mean QLQ-C30 GHS/QoL scale score was 60.54 in the pembro-EP arm and 58.37 in the placebo-EP arm at baseline. Score improved in both arms at wk 18; the least squares mean change from baseline (95% CI) was 8.66 points (5.26-12.06) in the pembro-EP arm and 4.23 points (0.93-7.52) in the placebo-EP arm for a difference in least squares means of 4.43 points (95% CI 0.21-8.66;  P  = .040). Median TTD in the QLQ-C30/LC13 composite of cough, chest pain, or dyspnea was not reached (NR) for pembro-EP and was 8.7 mo for placebo-EP (HR 0.80 [95% CI 0.56-1.14];  P  = .208). Median TTD in the QLQ-C30 GHS/QoL scale was NR in either arm (HR 0.78 [95% CI 0.52-1.18];  P  = .238). Conclusions Adding pembro to EP did not decrease, and may improve, HRQoL compared with placebo-EP as first-line therapy for ES-SCLC. Along with the efficacy and safety data observed in KEYNOTE-604, PRO data support the benefit of pembro in SCLC. Clinical trial identification NCT03066778, originally posted on February 28, 2017.

Methods Enrollment criteria were as follows: Japanese patients with advanced or metastatic MPM previously treated with up to two chemotherapy regimens, with histologically confirmed measurable lesions and an ECOG performance status (PS) of 0-1. There was no restriction on the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) status. Patients received nivolumab 240 mg/body every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity was indicated. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) (mRECIST assessment by an independent review committee), and the secondary endpoints were disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. Results Thirty-four patients were enrolled in this study: 85.3% men; median age: 68.0 (43\u201378) years; PS 1: 61.8%; epithelioid/sarcomatoid/biphasic: 79.4%/8.8%/11.8%; 1 prior regimen: 70.6%; and (PD-L1\u22651%)/(PD-L1 < 1%)/not evaluable: 58.8%/35.3%/5.9%.At a minimum follow-up of 36 months, ORR and DCR were 29.4% [n=10, 95% CI: 16.8\u201346.2] and 67.6% (n=23,95% CI: 50.8\u201380.9), respectively. Median DOR was 11.1 months (95% CI: 3.5\u201328.6+). At the data cutoff date (November 2019), seven patients were alive. Two- and three-year OS rates were 35.3% (95% CI: 19.9\u201351.0) and 23.5% (95% CI: 11.1\u201338.6), respectively. Furthermore, two- and three-year PFS rates were 17.0% (95% CI: 6.3\u201332.0) and 12.7% (95% CI: 3.7\u201327.6), respectively.Overall, 26 patients (76.5%) experienced treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) and 11 (32.4%) were grade 3-4. The most commonly reported TRAEs were skin disorders (n=6,17.6%), elevated lipase (n=5,14.7%), elevated amylase levels (n=4,11.8%), and diarrhea (n=4,11.8%). Conclusions Nivolumab showed durable long-term efficacy and a manageable safety profile in Japanese patients with MPM receiving second- and third-line treatment.

Due to lack of validated imaging response criteria, responder-subgroups with potential survival benefit have not yet been identified. Here, we administered high-dose pembrolizumab (10 mg/kg, d 1 , q2w) considering the KEYNOTE-028 trial and assessed the prognostic value of PET metabolic response in patients with chemotherapy-resistant malignant mesothelioma of the pleura or peritoneum. Methods Data from 27 patients with baseline and follow-up  18 F-FDG PET/CT imaging were retrospectively analyzed. RECIST v1.1, mRECIST, PERCIST SULpeak  and PERCIST MTV  were used separately to categorize responders in CT and PET imaging studies. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of responders were compared to non-responders using Kaplan-Meier and log-rank analyses. Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 (PD-L1) expression status was assessed and its association with outcome was investigated. Results 27 patients had  18 F-FDG-PET/CT imaging at baseline and after at least 4 cycles pembrolizumab. Median PFS and OS were 3.4 and 15.1 months, respectively. Response rates were 7%, 7%, 30%, and 30% based on RECIST v1.1, mRECIST, PERCIST SULpeak , and PERCIST MTV  response criteria, respectively. Response according to PERCIST MTV  predicted prolonged OS or PFS (p < 0.01), whereas all other imaging criteria and PD-L1 expression did not. Conclusions                       18 F-FDG PET metabolic volume response predicts survival in patients with malignant mesothelioma receiving high-dose pembrolizumab.

We report updated, exploratory analyses of survival outcomes at 4 years, including the first estimate of median OS for the durvalumab arm. Methods Pts with WHO PS 0/1 (any tumour PD-L1 status) who had received \u22652 cycles of platinum-based cCRT (RT dosage typically 60\u201366 Gy in 30\u201333 fractions) were enrolled and randomised (2:1), 1\u201342 days post-cCRT, to IV durvalumab 10 mg/kg or pbo (q2w for \u226412 months), stratified by age, sex, and smoking history. Primary endpoints were PFS (blinded independent central review; RECIST v1.1) and OS (both measured from the time of randomisation). HRs and 95% CIs were estimated using a stratified log-rank test in the ITT population. Medians and OS/PFS rates at 48 months were estimated by Kaplan\u2013Meier method. Results In total, 709/713 randomised patients received durvalumab (n/N=473/476) and pbo (n/N=236/237). The last pt had completed study treatment in May 2017, almost 3 years prior to the current DCO. As of 20 Mar 2020 (current DCO; median follow up, 34.2 months [range, 0.2\u201364.9]), updated PFS (stratified HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.44\u20130.67; median 17.2 vs 5.6 months) and OS (stratified HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57\u20130.88) remained consistent with previous reports. Median OS for the durvalumab arm was determined for the first time: 47.5 months (pbo, 29.1 months). The 48-month OS rates were 49.6% vs 36.3% for durvalumab vs pbo, and PFS rates were 35.3% vs 19.5% respectively. Updates to treatment effects for pt subgroups will be reported. Conclusions These updated analyses of PFS and OS demonstrate durable benefit with durvalumab after cCRT. Approximately half of patients randomised to durvalumab in PACIFIC remain alive at 4 years, and about a third remain both alive and progression free, almost 3 years after the last pt completed study treatment.

However, it has not been explored whether EGFR-TKI plus concurrent thoracic radiotherapy may be effective in locally-advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR mutation. Methods Chemotherapy-na\u00efve, locally-advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR mutation were enrolled. Patients were treated with gefitinib (250mg/day, p.o. for 2 years) plus concurrent thoracic radiotherapy (64Gy/32frs). Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) at 2 years. Secondary endpoints consisted of overall response rate (ORR), PFS, overall survival (OS) and safety. Based on the hypothesis that this treatment will improve PFS rate at 2 years from 20 to 40% (0.05 of one-sided \u03b1 and 0.25 of \u03b2), 27 patients are required (Trial Identifier, UMIN000008366). Results Between Aug 2012 and Nov 2017, 28 patients were enrolled and 27 were eligible. Of those, median age was 67 (range, 45-74); male/female 7/20; never/current or former smoker 15/12; ECOG performance status 0/1 19/8; EGFR exon 19 deletion/exon 21 L858R 13/14; c-stage IIIA/IIIB 14/13. PFS rate at 2 years by independent review was 29.6% (one-sided 95% confidence interval [CI]: 17.6%-). ORR was 81.5% (95%CI: 66.5% to not reached), median PFS was 28.6 months (95%CI: 12.0 to 24.5 months), and median OS was 61.1 months (95%CI: 38.1 months to not reached). Adverse events \u2265Gr 3 were fatigue, skin reaction and appetite loss (3.7%, respectively). Pneumonitis was frequently observed, but all events were mild (Gr1 59.2% and Gr2 29.6%). Conclusions Among unresectable locally-advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR mutation, gefitinib with concurrent thoracic radiotherapy did not improve PFS rate at 2 years.

PD-(L)1 inhibitors have recently shown high response rates in resectable NSCLC. Methods Neoadjuvant treatment consisted of 3 cycles of cis 100 mg/m 2  and doce 85 mg/m 2  q3w followed by 2 cycles of durvalumab 750 mg q2w. Durvalumab was continued after surgery for 1 year. The primary endpoint is EFS at 1 year. The hypothesis for statistical considerations was an improvement of EFS at 1 year from 48% to 65%. Results Sixty-eight patients were included. Radiographic response rate was 44.8% (95%CI: 32.6-57.4) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (CR: 4.5%, PR: 40.3%, SD: 44.8%) and 58.1% (95%CI: 44.8-70.5) after additional neoadjuvant immunotherapy (CR: 6.5%, PR: 51.6%, SD: 25.8%). Of the 55 resected patients, 10 patients (18.2%) had a pathological complete response and 33 patients (60.0%) a major pathological response defined as \u226410% viable tumor cells by central pathology review. Postoperative nodal down-staging was observed in 37 patients (67.3%). 1-year EFS was 73.3% (90%CI: 60.1-82.7). At the time of the analysis, median EFS was not reached. After a median follow up of 28 months, median OS was not reached. Thirteen patients had died with disease progression/disease recurrence as the most frequent reason (11 patients). 59 patients (88.1%) had an AE grade \u22653 including two fatal cases (one postoperative bleeding complication and one respiratory failure). Results for PD-L1 expression and tumor mutational burden will be presented during the meeting. Conclusions This is to our knowledge the largest study of patients with resectable stage IIIA(N2) NSCLC investigating perioperative immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. The addition of perioperative durvalumab to standard of care cis/doce is safe and results in a encouraging 1-year EFS rate exceeding historical data of chemotherapy alone and achieves a high major pathological response rate.

In a clinical trial (NCT03296137) we have tested the potential of TIL-based ACT across cancer types. Methods Twenty-five patients with 12 different cancer diagnoses were treated with ex vivo expanded TILs at Herlev University Hospital between 2017 and 2019. The ACT was preceded by a single dose of ipilimumab before tumor removal and combined with 4 doses of nivolumab before and after cell infusion. Patients were hospitalized for conditioning chemotherapy before T cell infusion followed by 14 days of low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2). Results Four patients (16%) - 2 with head-and-neck cancer, 1 cholangiocarcinoma and 1 sarcoma \u2013 obtained a partial response to therapy, 17 patients stabile disease and 4 progressive disease. Median progression-free survival was 88 days. Overall, the therapy regimen was tolerated and safe in all patients with expected side effects comparable to malignant melanoma ACT TIL trials but with the addition of immune related adverse events from the checkpoint inhibitors. The ex vivo expansion of TILs was successful in 30/31 recruited patients across cancer types with a median expansion time of 24 days. In-depth immune phenotyping of the TILs both in the tumor and after ex vivo expansion along with ex vivo anti-tumor reactivity will be presented. Conclusions Our data show that TIL-based ACT in combination with checkpoint inhibitors is safe and feasible. We show that clinical responses can be obtained in previously unreported cancer types and confirm that TIL-therapy has a potential in non-melanoma patients. Clinical trial identification NCT03296137.

ALKS 4230 is being investigated as monotherapy & in combination with pembro in pts with solid tumors. We report extended follow-up from combination therapy and new ALKS 4230 monotherapy data. Methods ARTISTRY-1 (NCT02799095) is an ongoing 3-part phase I/II study. In Parts A (dose escalation) and B (expansion), ALKS 4230 is administered as IV monotherapy on days 1-5 of 14- or 21-day cycles. In Part C (combination therapy), ALKS 4230 is administered via the same 5-day regimen q21d with pembro on day 1. Outcomes presented include safety, PK/pharmacodynamics, RP2D, and antitumor activity (RECIST v1.1 & iRECIST) from Parts B & C (response data cut: 4/29/2020; all other data: 3/23/2020). Results In Part B, 9 pts (5 melanoma, 4 RCC) received 6 \u03bcg/kg (RP2D). The most common adverse events (AEs) were grade \u22642 (fevers, chills, hypotension [not requiring vasopressors]). No treatment-related deaths occurred; no AEs led to treatment discontinuation. One pt with metastatic urethral melanoma (which had previously recurred following adjuvant nivolumab) achieved partial response (PR) to 6 \u03bcg/kg ALKS 4230 monotherapy with normalization of serum LDH. In Part C, 46 pts (13 tumor types) received ALKS 4230 (3 \u03bcg/kg) and pembro. The most common tumor types (\u22655 each) were colorectal, ovarian (OC), & sarcoma. Addition of pembro did not alter the PK/pharmacodynamics of ALKS 4230; no new toxicities were observed. Among pts with \u22651 scan, 1 heavily pretreated pt with OC achieved complete response (per RECIST) & continues therapy >12 months; PR was seen in 2 other OC pts (1 pt awaiting confirmatory scan) who received therapy for 7 & 3 months, respectively, both ongoing; iPR was seen in 1 pt with triple-negative breast cancer (on therapy >12 months). All 4 responders were checkpoint inhibitor naive. Conclusions ALKS 4230 is a promising novel agent given its tolerability & efficacy profile, which includes single agent activity & durable responses even in a pretreated pt population. Future research of mono & combination therapy with ALKS 4230 is warranted. Clinical trial identification NCT02799095.

Retifanlimab (INCMGA00012), a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that recognizes human programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), has demonstrated activity and tolerability across a broad range of solid tumors. POD1UM-202 was designed to evaluate retifanlimab in pts with previously treated advanced SCAC. Methods Phase II, single-arm study in pts 18 years or older with progression following standard therapy and RECIST measurable disease. Prior immunotherapy was not allowed. Pts with well-controlled human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection were eligible. Retifanlimab was administered intravenously at 500 mg every 4 weeks. The primary study endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) assessed by independent central review (ICR) per RECIST v1.1. Results 94 pts were enrolled with median age of 64 years, most were female (64.9%) and white (76.6%), and had an ECOG PS of 0 (41.5%) or 1 (58.5%). 73.4% had received prior CRT, 17% RT alone, and 97% had received platinum. Liver metastasis was reported in 39 (41.5%) pts and 9 (9.6%) were known to be HIV-positive. Median (range) duration of follow-up was 7 (<1\u201319) months. ICR confirmed responses were reported in 13 (13.8%) pts (1 complete response; 12 partial responses) and 33 (35.1%) pts had stable disease; median (range) DOR was 9.5 (5.6\u2013not estimable) months. Responses were observed regardless of PD-L1 expression, liver metastases, or HIV-positive status. Median (95% CI) PFS and OS were 2.3 (1.9\u20133.6) and 10.1 (7.9\u2013NE) months, respectively. Responses were associated with marked prolongation of PFS and OS. Retifanlimab was well-tolerated, including in the HIV-positive population, with a safety profile as expected for a PD-1 inhibitor and a low incidence of treatment discontinuation due to immune-related adverse events (2.1%). Conclusions Results from this large phase 2 trial demonstrate encouraging efficacy and an acceptable safety profile with retifanlimab in pts with previously treated advanced or metastatic SCAC, including pts with well-controlled HIV infection.

The objective of this phase I study was to evaluate the safety/tolerability and describe immune-mediated effects of nivo in patients (pts) with HIV-associated ST. Methods Pts received nivo at 3 mg/kg q 2 wk, in two dose de-escalation cohorts stratified by CD4 count (Stratum 1: CD4 counts > 200/uL and Stratum 2: CD4 count 100-200/uL) in pts with ST. An expansion cohort of 24 patients with CD4 count > 200 was then enrolled. Results A total of 37 pts were treated with nivo (n=4, 9, 24 for strata 1/2 and expansion cohorts). Histologies included Kaposi Sarcoma [KS](n=15), anal cancer [ca](n=5), lung ca (n=4) and other ST (n=13). No pts experienced dose-limiting toxicities (evaluable n=3 [stratum 1] and n=6 [stratum 2]). Treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were experienced by 14 (38%) pts. The most common treatment-related AEs were fatigue (n=5) and maculo-papular rash (n=4); of which, grade 3/4 severity was experienced by 2 pts each. Objective response rate (RR) by modified WHO criteria was 24% (9/37); with partial response (PR) in pts with KS (n=5), anal ca (n=1), colon ca (n=1), adenocarcinoma of the gall bladder (n=1), and squamous cell ca (n=1). There were no significant changes detected in HIV viral load (VL) during the study, which was undetectable for 97% of participants at baseline. Baseline median absolute CD4 was 315 (IQR, 225-434), and there was a trend for a reduction at 6-week (wk) post-treatment follow-up [f/u] (median difference: -35 (IQR, -83 to 37), p=0.072). Median CD4/CD8 ratio at baseline was 0.41 (IQR, 0.33-0.75) and increased by a median of 0.10 (IQR, -0.05 to 0.14, p=0.060) and 0.08 (IQR, 0 to 0.18, p=0.021) at 6- and 16 wk post-treatment f/u. Conclusions Nivo has acceptable safety in HIV patients with ST. Plasma viremia remained suppressed during the study suggesting no viral reactivation, and CD4/CD8 count ratio was increased at 16 wk post-treatment. A RR of 24% was observed in tumors known to be responsive to ICB. Thus, it is appropriate for HIV+ pts with ST treated with ART and a CD4 +  T-cell count of greater than 100 cells/\u03bcL and undetectable VL to receive nivo in clinical trials and FDA-approved indications.

CLEVER-1 inhibition in mice reactivates CD8+ T-cell response with a robust anti-tumor activity. FP-1305 is a novel IgG4-antibody targeting CLEVER-1 and induces a phenotypic M2 to M1 immune switch of TAMs. Methods MATINS ( M acrophage  A ntibody  T o  IN hibit immune  S uppression) trial is a three-part, first-in-human phase I/II study (NCT03733990) to assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of FP-1305 in patients with advanced solid tumours. The Part I has been completed. In Part II, 110 subjects with solid tumours will be enrolled for efficacy (ORR) and safety. Results In Part I, 30 patients were enrolled into five different dose levels (0.1 - 10 mg/kg) and received 1-8 doses (median 3) of FP-1305 q3w. FP-1305 was well tolerated without dose-limiting toxicities. 28.9 % of the treatment emergent adverse events were related to the study drug. The half-life of FP-1305 (t1/2) was 19.5 h (CV% 51.0). The disease control rate in target lesions was 27% and the overall response rate according to RECIST 1.1 was 3%. Peripheral increase in NK cells, CD4+, CD8+, CD8+/CD4+ T cells ratio, B cells and a decrease in regulatory T cells was observed after FP-1305 dosing. Also at least a 20 % increase of systemic IFN\u03b3 in 40 % of patients and CXCL10 in 33 % of patients was observed. FP-1305 dosing led to activation (CD25+) and Th1 skewing (CXCR3+) of T cell populations including increase in effector CD8 T-cell population with downregulation of several inhibitory immune checkpoint molecules (PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4 and LAG3). Data will be updated for PK and efficacy. Conclusions FP-1305 administration in advanced cancer patients can promote immune switch and peripheral lymphocyte activation alongside promising tolerability. Despite relatively short half-life, durable Th1 activation and mobilization of NK and B cells accompanied with persistent IFN\u03b3 and CXCL10 induction was observed. Despite formal progression according to RECIST, potential anti-tumour activity was noted with some target lesions showing regression or stability in several patients. Targeting Clever-1 holds promise as a novel immunotherapy. Clinical trial identification NCT03733990. Legal entity responsible for the study Faron Pharmaceuticals LTD.

Upon TCR/CD3 engagement, simultaneous binding of FAP and 4-1BB results in clustering and activation of T- and NK- cells at the tumor site, thereby leading to potent anti-tumor activity in a panel of preclinical models. Methods This is a 3-part FIH study: Part A and B explored the safety, PK, PD and anti-tumor activity to establish the recommended dose for expansion (RDE) into Part C of RO as single agent (SA) and in combination with ATZ, respectively. Part C assesses the efficacy and safety of the combination in selected, FAP positive tumors. Preliminary results of Part A/B are presented here, where patients (pts) were treated with RO weekly (QW) at escalated dose levels (DLs). Results Part A: 62 pts were treated at 13 DLs, range 5 \u2013 2000 mg IV. Part B (plus ATZ 1200 mg Q3W): 39 pts at 8 DLs, 45 \u2013 2000 mg IV. Serum exposure (C max ; AUC) increased dose dependently, with evidence of non-linearity in elimination at lower doses, suggestive of target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD). In blood, expression of 4-1BB and release of soluble 4-1BB indicated T-cell activation and 4-1BB targeting. Paired tumor biopsies revealed strong accumulation of CD8+Ki67+ T-cells. Adverse events (AEs) were generally mild to moderate (i.e., G1-2) across both parts. Most common AEs \u2265 G3 in Part A were asthenia (6.5%), AST elevation and pneumonia (each 4.8%), whereas pneumonia, pneumonitis (each 10.3%), neutro- and lymphocytopenia (each 7.7%) were most frequent in Part B. DLTs were febrile neutropenia G3 (45 mg), CRS G3 (130 mg) and pneumonitis G3 (500 mg plus ATZ); a MTD was not reached. Objective response rates were 3.6% (A) and 18.4% (B). Conclusions RO demonstrated an acceptable safety profile as SA and in combination with ATZ. PK and PD- effects were favorable and consistent with the antibody-like format and the postulated MoA, respectively. Preliminary anti-tumor activity supports further exploration of the combination in tumor-specific indications. Clinical trial identification EUDRACT Number: 2017-003961-83; Protocol Number: BP40087.

This pleiotropic mechanism of action, along with durable responses to PT-112 alone in ICI non-responding pts, prompted this combination study with avelumab (\u201cPAVE\u201d), from which we present results of dose escalation. Methods A 3+3 design was used to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for PT-112 (28-day cycle IV days 1, 8, 15) with avelumab 800 mg (days 1 and 15) in pts with progressing solid tumors, with no available effective therapy (Tx). Previous ICI Tx was allowed. Results Across five dose cohorts (150, 200, 250, 300, and 360 mg/m 2  PT-112) 36 pts were enrolled: 7 non-small cell lung, 6 urothelial, 4 breast, 3 castration-resistant prostate (CRPC), and 1 squamous head and neck, plus 15 supplemental CRPC pts enrolled at 200 mg/m 2  to enhance safety and efficacy data. PAVE was well tolerated with no dose limiting toxicity. Common treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were nausea (47%), fatigue (31%), thrombocytopenia (28%), and decreased appetite (28%); 44% of pts had grade 3-4 TRAEs (most frequent was thrombocytopenia: 17%). The PT-112 RP2D is 360 mg/m 2 , as reported for PT-112 single agent. Median prior lines of systemic Tx differed for escalation pts (4) and supplemental CRPC pts (6), and modified dosing was effective in pts with limited bone-marrow reserve. Of 12 pts with measurable disease and imaging follow-up in escalation, 8 experienced stable disease (4 with prior ICI Tx). Two CRPC pts responded: one with durable improved PSA and bone metastases, PFS 11.4 months (150mg/m 2 , MSI stable); another with confirmed RECIST partial response (66% reduction), PSA reduction (94%), bone scan improvement, and ongoing PFS 9.5 months (200 mg/m 2 , PIK3CBmut and PTEN loss, prior ICI Tx). 4 of 18 total CRPC pts had reductions in PSA \u226550%; 15 of 18 in alkaline phosphatase. Conclusions PAVE combination Tx was feasible and well-tolerated in a heavily pre-treated population. Preliminary evidence of efficacy was observed across a range of PT-112 doses, and further investigation of the combination is ongoing in the phase IIa portion of the protocol.

This study investigated the potency of anlotinib in treating locally advanced or metastatic radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid carcinoma (RAIR-DTC). Methods This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter phase II trial (NCT02586337). Eligible pts were 18-70 years age, ECOG PS of 0-1 and diagnosed as having pathologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic RAIR-DTC with at least one measurable lesion. Previous anlotinib or other VEGFR-TKIs were not allowed. Pts were randomized (2:1) to receive anlotinib or placebo (12mg QD for 2 weeks every 3 weeks). The primary endpoint was PFS. The secondary endpoints included ORR, DCR, OS, Quality of life and safety. Pts in placebo arm could receive open-label anlotinib after disease progression. Results Between September 2015 and August 2018, 113 pts (76 in anlotinib arm, 37 in placebo arm) were enrolled. The data cutoff date for primary endpoint was January 1, 2020. The research met its endpoint that the median PFS was 40.54 months (95% CI 28.29, NE) in anlotinib arm and 8.38 months (95% CI 5.59, 13.80) in placebo arm ( p  < 0.0001). The HR was 0.21 (95% CI 0.12, 0.37). OS data was immature while a trend of OS benefit could be observed (Not reached vs. 52.83 months; HR = 0.57 [95% CI 0.29, 1.12];  p  = 0.0976). This prolongation in OS became significant (HR = 0.36 [95%CI 0.18, 0.73],  P  = 0.0033) when a potential bias from crossover (24 pts received open-label anlotinib) was adjusted with a two-stage estimation method. ORR was 59.21% in anlotinib arm and no response was observed in placebo arm ( p  < 0.0001). DCR was 97.37% versus 78.38% ( p  = 0.0019). 26 pts in anlotinib arm needed dose reduction. The incidence of treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) in anlotinib and placebo arms was 100.00% and 86.49%. Serious TRAEs occurred in 15.79% pts received anlotinib. The most common TRAEs in anlotinib arm were hypertension (84.21%) and hand-foot syndrome (73.68%).

Methods In this phase III, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial involving pts with progressive RAIR-DTC, eligible pts were randomized (1:1) to either 500 mg apatinib orally once daily or placebo. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and safety. The planned sample size was 118 pts, with 90% power to detect a 6.2-month improvement in PFS at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05. A planned interim analysis would be performed when 60% of expected events occurred. Results Between February 2017 to March 2020, 92 pts from 20 sites were randomized to apatinib (n=46) or placebo (n=46) arms. The pre-planned interim analysis was performed by the independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) in March 2020 upon the occurrence of 61.45% (51/83) PFS events. The median PFS was 22.21 months (95% CI 10.91-Not Reached) in apatinib group, and 4.47 months (95% CI 1.94-9.17) in the placebo group (HR=0.26, 95% CI 0.14-0.47, p<0.0001), and the p-value was less than the prespecified interim efficacy margin (\u03b1=0.0085). ORR was 55.56% vs. 2.27%. The median OS was 29.9 months (95% CI 18.96-Not reached) in the placebo arm, and not reached in apatinib arm (HR=0.42, 95% CI 0.18-0.97, p=0.0356). The most frequent treatment-emergent \u2265 grade 3 adverse events in two arms were hypertension (34.8% vs 0%), hand-foot syndrome (17.4% vs 0%) and proteinuria (17.4% vs 2.2%).

Achieving locoregional disease control in the neck is critical due to major concerns of airway and esophageal compromise. Based on data suggesting synergy between pazopanib (P) and paclitaxel (T) in ATC, NRG Oncology conducted a randomized phase II study comparing concurrent T and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with either P or placebo (C). Methods The study arm evaluated 2-3 weeks of weekly T (80 mg/m2) and daily P suspension (PS) 400 mg followed by concurrent weekly T (50 mg/m2), daily PS (300 mg), and IMRT 66 Gy. The standard arm substituted C for PS. Inclusion criteria included pathologic diagnosis of M0/M1 ATC (central path review), Zubrod 0-2, no recent hemoptysis/bleeding, no brain metastases. Target accrual was 88 patients (pts) (79 eligible) to show a  > 37.5% reduction in the hazard rate for overall survival (OS) with addition of PS (1-sided alpha 0.15, beta 0.2). Final analysis, after accounting for 1 interim analysis, was 1-sided log-rank test at 0.1379 level in eligible pts. Results 89 pts (71 eligible) were accrued from 6/23/14-12/30/16, completing accrual 14 months earlier than projected. Pts excluded per protocol in each arm - PS 6; C 12. Median age 65 years. Female 52.1%. Zubrod 0-1 91.5%. Total thyroidectomy 36.6%; partial thyroidectomy 21.1%. M0 disease 56.3%. OS was not significantly higher with PS compared to C (p=0.28); hazard ratio (PS/C) was 0.86 (95% CI 0.52 - 1.43). OS and adverse events (AE) rates are in the table.

In this context, and given the relevance of dysregulated metabolism in cancer, the aim of our study was to assess the metabolomic profile of NET pts to better understand metabolic dysregulation in this tumors and identify novel biomarkers of potential clinical use. Methods Multiplatform untargeted metabolomic profiling was performed in plasma of 77 pts with advanced GI and lung NETs, and of 68 control pts, matched per age, gender and IMC. Samples were analyzed by GC, CE and LC, coupled to MS. Differences between NETs and controls were performed by Univariate (MATLAB, t-Student ( p \u22640.05)) and Multivariate analysis (SIMCA15.0). Related pathways were explored by MPA/MSEA using Metaboanalyst 4.0. ROC and OPLS-DA were used to select metabolites with biomarker potential (AUC>0.85 or VIP>1). Logistic regression models were built to identify confounding clinical covariables. AdjAUCs were calculated with model probabilities of each diagnostic metabolite. Results We identified 155 differential compounds between NETs and controls, 14 of them by several techniques. The main biochemical groups of identified metabolites were amino acids (27.7%), fatty acids (16.1%), glycerophopholipids (14.1%), steroids (9.6%) and carbohydrates (3.8%). Specifically, we detected an increase of dipeptides and oxidized lipids in NETs, a decrease of carnitine levels and a rise of oxidized compounds derived from arachidonic acid (HETE). Differential metabolites were related with classical cancer pathways (apoptosis, cell cycle) and NET signalling (tryptophan metabolism, angiogenesis, mTOR). MPA/MSEA showed 32 novel enriched metabolic pathways in NETs, related with TCA cycle and with arginine, pyruvate or glutathione metabolism. Finally, OPLS-DA, ROC and LRM models showed 46 metabolites of diagnostic potential. Conclusions This study provides, for the first time, a comprehensive metabolic profile of NET pts. The study identified a reduced set of metabolites of potential diagnostic utility and also reveals new enriched metabolic pathways that may open new avenues of clinical research, including novel targets of therapy.

The aim of this study was to analyze the prognostic factors in a large cohort of G3 GEP-NEC from the Spanish Registry. Methods R-GETNE includes 4807 GEP-NENs diagnosed between 2004 and 2019. The study cohort included patients with poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC) with a Ki67 index >20%. Results Of 535 patients with G3 NEC, 29% were \u226570 years (median age 64), 40% women and 85% had ECOG 0-1. The most common primary sites were colorectum (30%), pancreas (24%), unknown (16%), stomach (13%), and small intestine (4%). Stage at diagnosis was I in 3%, II in 9%, III in 20% and IV in 68%. 87% of stage I-III NECs were resected and, of these, 54% received adjuvant chemotherapy. Platin and etoposide was administered to 73% of patients with advanced NECs with a response rate of 64% and a median progression-free survival of 6.1 months. With a median follow-up of 4 years, 353 patients (67%) had died and the median overall survival (OS) was 14 months. Median OS by stage was: stage I, 6.1 years (1.8-NA); II, 5.8 years (1.9-NA); III, 2.1 years (1.5-6.7); and IV, 9.7 months (6.7-12.9). In stage IV, OS by site was: small intestine, 14.0 (12.6-15.8); pancreas, 10.1 (9.5-11.8); rectum, 9.9 (8.2-11.2); stomach, 7.3 (5.2-9.3); colon, 4.7 (2.8-7.0) and unknown primary, 2.7 months (1.9-3.8). Multivariate analysis showed that stage (I-III vs IV, HR 0.43, 0.27\u20130.81); primary site (small intestine, pancreas and rectum vs others, HR 0.63, 0.44\u20130.92); ECOG (0-1 vs 2, HR 0.64, 0.37-0.77), and gender (women vs men, HR 0.89, 0.74-0.95) were independent prognostic factors for OS (p<0.05).

SDH  encodes for a TCA enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of succinate to fumarate. When mutated SDH losses its function, leading to succinate accumulation. We have evaluated serum succinate levels as a new biomarker in  SDHx -mutated MPP patients. Methods Retrospective monocentric study of 88 MPP patients (43 sporadic:  SDHxWT;  45 mutated  SDHx , among which 35 where  SDHB ) and 17 tumor-free familial asymptomatic carriers ( SDH-B:  13,  SDH-C:  2,  SDH-D: 2 ). Clinical and biological data were available in all. 18F-FDG-PET was available in 32 metastatic MPP (15 sporadic, 17  SDH-B) . 18F-FDG-PET analyses were performed on an Advantage Workstation (GE Healthcare). A healthy control group (n=10) is included. Serum succinate levels (n=290) were quantified by LC-MS/MS (Waters). Statistical analyses were performed with GraphpadPrism\u00ae. Results Serum succinate levels were increased in the disease-free  SDHx  group (median: 7.3 \u03bcM) compared to the control group (median: 4.8 \u03bcM). Succinate levels >6.9 \u03bcM allowed to identify disease-free  SDHx  mutated cases compared to the healthy control group (100% specificity; 85% sensitivity). When tumor is detected, mutated  SDH-B  patients had a significantly increased median succinate level (13.5 \u03bcM) compared to sporadic patients (7.9 \u03bcM) (p<0.01). Metastatic  SDH-B  patients showed a higher median succinate level (14.9 \u03bcM). Extension of the metastatic disease evaluated by the total lesion glycolysis (TLG) activity (18F-FDG-PET) was correlated to the succinate levels (r=0.76). In the  SDHB  group, patients with the highest tumor burden (3 rd  and 4 th  TLG quartiles) showed significant increased succinate levels compared to the sporadic group (p<0.001). Conclusions Serum succinate is a metabolic biomarker that might be useful to identify  SDHx  mutated carriers (tumor-free familial asymptomatic carriers and metastatic MPP patients) and as a marker of metabolic tumor burden in patients with metastatic MPP.

Methods A prospective, single-arm, open-label, exploratory, international phase II study in patients with a metastatic or locally advanced, unresectable, G1/2 panNET or midgut NET, with centrally assessed progression within the last 2 years while on a standard LAN regimen for \u226524 weeks. Planned recruitment was 50 patients per cohort. LAN 120 mg q14 days was administered for 48 (panNET) or 96 (midgut) weeks (or until centrally-assessed progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity/tolerability, or death), or longer if <25 events had occurred. Results In the panNET (N=48) and midgut NET (N=51) cohorts, respectively, median (95% confidence interval [CI]) progression-free survival (PFS, primary endpoint) was 5.6 (5.5; 8.3) and 8.3 (5.6; 11.1) months. Post-hoc subgroup analysis in the panNET cohort showed median (95% CI) PFS of 8.0 (5.6; 8.3) months in patients with Ki67 \u226410% (N=43), and 2.8 (2.8; 2.9) months in patients with Ki67 >10% (N=5).

Cemiplimab, an antibody to PD-1, is an established therapy approved for treatment of advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) in pts who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation. Both BCC and CSCC are keratinocytic tumours with high mutational burden due to ultraviolet mutagenesis and are potentially amenable to immunotherapy. We present the primary analysis of the laBCC cohort from the pivotal phase II study of cemiplimab in the second-line (or greater) setting. Methods Pts with laBCC received cemiplimab 350 mg Q3W IV (for up to 93 weeks or until progression). The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) by Independent Central Review (ICR). Secondary objectives included assessment of safety and tolerability, estimation of duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). ORR included two responses confirmed after the data cut-off date of 17 February 2020. Results 84 pts were enrolled; 66.7% male; median age was 70 years (range: 42\u221289). Median follow-up was 15 months (range: 0.5\u221225). ORR per ICR was 31% (95% CI: 21\u221242), including five complete responses and 21 partial responses. Median DOR has not been reached; an estimated 85% of responses were ongoing at 12 months, per the Kaplan\u2013Meier method. Median PFS and OS had not been reached. Estimated PFS for all patients was 19 months. The most common adverse events (AEs) were fatigue (30%), diarrhoea (24%) and pruritus (21%); 17% of patients discontinued treatment due to AEs. Median baseline tumour mutational burden (TMB) was 58.2 and 23.5 mutations/Mb among responding (n=18) and non-responding (n=38) pts, respectively, but responses occurred at all TMB levels. Exploratory biomarker analysis identified downregulation of major histocompatibility complex-I expression as a potential immune evasion mechanism in non-responding BCCs with high TMB. Conclusions Cemiplimab is the first agent to establish clinical benefit for pts with laBCC who progress on or are intolerant to HHI therapy, regardless of biomarker status.

Chemotherapy or interferon are used for patients (pts) with extensive cutaneous and/or visceral KS but the tolerance may be poor in elderly pts, and long-term remissions are rare. Major efficacy of PD1 blockade has been demonstrated in Merkel cell carcinoma, another virus-induced tumor, in part driven by the immunogenicity of virus-associated antigens. Because of the involvement of HHV8 in KS and their good tolerance in older pts, the use of anti-PD1 appeared as a promising tool for classic/endemic KS. Methods We conducted a multicenter single arm phase II trial in pts with classic/endemic KS with cutaneous extension requiring systemic treatment. Pts were treated with pembrolizumab (pembro) 200mg every 3 weeks for 6 months. Tumor assessment was performed by physical examination at each cycle (count, size, nodularity and color of target cutaneous lesions). The primary endpoint was the best overall response rate (BORR, ACTG criteria). A tumor response probability >30% using the Simon\u2019s 2 stage optimal design was required to conclude that the drug was active. Results 17 pts (47% with classic and 53% with endemic KS) were included. 6 pts (35%) had lymph node extension. 12 pts (71%) were previously treated with chemotherapy. Median follow up was 25 weeks. Two pts had CR, 10 PR and 4 SD as best response (1 still on treatment; threshold of drug activity achieved). One pt discontinued treatment for toxicity. Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 11 pts (65%), including 1 grade 3 (6% - acute reversible cardiac decompensation). On baseline tumor samples, the lack of PDL1 expression on tumor and immune cells was associated with poor efficacy of pembro. The germline HLA-1 evolutionary divergence (HED) was determined for 16 pts. The 4 pts with SD as best response had significantly lower HED for HLA-B than pts with PR or CR. Conclusions In the first prospective trial assessing the role of PD1 blockade in classic/endemic KS, pembro showed efficacy with 12 out of 16 of pts having CR or PR (BORR above 30%) and had an acceptable safety profile. If confirmed, this treatment could rapidly become standard of care. Clinical trial identification NCT03469804. Legal entity responsible for the study AP-HP. Funding MSD. Disclosure J.

Autologous DCs, directly isolated from peripheral blood, loaded with tumor antigens and matured in vitro, can induce tumor-specific immune responses and clinical responses in cancer patients. Methods In this phase III clinical trial, patients with resected stage IIIB or IIIC cutaneous melanoma (AJCC 7 th  edition) were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to adjuvant treatment with DC vaccination or placebo. The active treatment arm consisted of intranodal injections with autologous CD1c+ myeloid DCs and plasmacytoid DCs loaded with tumor antigens (gp100, tyrosinase, MAGE-C2, MAGE-A3 and NY-ESO-1). When adjuvant treatment with anti-PD1 antibodies became available in the Netherlands in November 2018, accrual was stopped prematurely after inclusion of 151 patients. The primary endpoint is the 2-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate. Secondary endpoints include overall survival, immunological response and safety. Results In January 2020, we performed a preplanned interim analysis. At that time, 102 patients reached mature data for primary endpoint analysis (recurrence of disease within 2 years of randomisation or at least 2-year follow-up). Thirty-eight percent of patients were female and the median age at start was 55.7 years (range 27-78). At inclusion, 51% of patients had stage IIIB disease and 49% stage IIIC disease. Two-year RFS rate was 21.4% in the treatment arm and 25% in the control arm (HR 1.05; 95% CI: 0.47-3.23), providing no statistically significant evidence of a treatment effect (p=0.67). Conclusions Our phase III clinical trial with adjuvant DC vaccination in stage IIIB and IIIC melanoma patients showed no benefit over placebo in terms of 2-year RFS.

Although first line dabrafenib-trametinib and ipilimumab-nivolumab (I-N) have similar intracranial response rates (50-55%), durable responses are only seen with combination immunotherapy and CNS resistance to BRAF-MEK inhibitors (BRAF-MEKi) usually occurs within 6 months. We sought to investigate the utility of I-N after BRAF-MEKi CNS progression and identify resistance mechanisms. Methods All patients receiving second/third line I-N for CNS metastases from 1/3/15 to 1/8/18 with prior progression on BRAF-MEKi and MRI brain staging were included. Modified intracranial RECIST was used to assess response. Formalin fixed paraffin embedded samples of BRAF V600 mutant CNS metastases na\u00efve to treatment (n=18) or excised after progression on BRAF-MEKi (n=14) underwent whole transcriptome sequencing. Comparative analyses of CNS samples na\u00efve to systemic treatment versus BRAF-MEKi progression was performed. Results Thirty patients received second/third line I-N with median CNS diameter of 21 mm. Modest efficacy of I-N after BRAF-MEKi progression was observed with an intracranial response rate of 4.8% (1/21) and median PFS of 5.5 weeks. Given the poor activity of I-N after BRAF-MEKi CNS progression we investigated the mechanisms that also conferred resistance to immunotherapy. We identified 179 differentially expressed genes (DEG) between na\u00efve and BRAF-MEKi progression CNS metastases (p < 0.05, false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.1). Gene set enrichment analysis with KEGG, GO or Hallmark libraries did not identify distinct pathways. Enrichment of DEG from the Innate anti-PD1 Resistance Signature (IPRES) was identified (p < 0.01, FDR = 0.03). Macrophage associated chemokines and myeloid activation genes were upregulated in CNS progression samples. Histological assessment showed increased macrophage grading in BRAF-MEKi progression samples (mean 1.45 vs 0.45, p=0.009). Conclusions I-N after CNS BRAF-MEKi progression has modest intracranial activity. CNS metastases resistant to BRAF-MEKi showed expression of the IPRES gene signature and upregulation of myeloid cell activation markers. Legal entity responsible for the study The authors.

BOR prior to SP was SD (15%), partial response (55%) and complete response (30%). Local therapy was mainly surgery (56%), radiotherapy (35%) or both (5%). Median follow-up from start ICI was 43 months (m), median time to SP 13m and median time to second progression after treatment of SP (TTSP) 33m. Median overall survival (OS) was not reached, estimated 3-year OS was 79%. SP occurred in 143 pts on ICI (median 11m) and in 151 pts off ICI (median 17m from start ICI, 9m from stop ICI). SP was treated with local + systemic therapy (42%), local therapy (36%) or systemic therapy only (18%). Second progression was mostly progression at multiple sites (64% and 65% for SP on and off ICI). In pts with SP on ICI, median TTSP was 29m. Local therapy + ICI continuation (N=94) resulted in similar 3-year TTSP as local therapy (N=15) or ICI continuation only (N=14, P=0.971). OS at 3 years was superior for local therapy + ICI continuation (P=0.020). In pts with SP off ICI, median TTSP was 35m. ICI restart + local therapy (N=22, 85%) resulted in superior TTSP compared to local therapy (N=90, 41%) or ICI restart (N=18, 56%, P=0.002), without OS differences so far. Conclusions In pts with SP off ICI, the combination of local therapy + ICI restart was most successful in delaying further progression, but did not improve OS so far compared to single modality treatment. Local therapy + ICI continuation in pts with SP on ICI did not improve TTSP, but did improve OS. This indicates that local therapy can benefit pts. Legal entity responsible for the study The authors.

Temozolomide and fotemustine (FTM) have been the therapeutic mainstay of melanoma (MM) patients (pts) with BM for over two decades. The Italian Network for Tumor Biotherapy (NIBIT)-M1 trial firstly demostrated signs of activity of ipilimumab (Ipi) combined with FTM in a subset of 20 MM pts with active BM (Di Giacomo,  Lancet Oncol , 2012), with a 3-year survival rate of 28% (Di Giacomo,  Annals Oncol , 2015). Two subsequent phase II studies reported the efficacy of Ipi combined with nivolumab (Nivo) in MM pts with asymptomatic BM (Twabi,  NEJM 2018 ; Long,  Lancet Oncol  2018). We here report the results of the primary analysis of the NIBIT-M2 study, the first phase III trial that explored the efficacy of Ipi  plus  Nivo in MM pts with BM. Methods The NIBIT-M2 is a phase III, multicenter, open-label study in MM pts with active, untreated, and asymptomatic BM.  BRAF  wilde type or mutant pts were randomized to receive FTM (ARM A), the combination of Ipi and FTM (ARM B), or the combination of Ipi and Nivo (ARM C). Primary objective was overall survival (OS); among secondary were intracranial ( i ) objective response rate ( i ORR),  i  disease control rate ( i DCR), and progression free survival (PFS). Results From January 2013 to September 2018, 96 MM pts were enrolled, 80 randomized, and 76 were treated: 23 in ARM A, 26 in ARM B, and 27 in ARM C. With a median follow-up of 39 months (mo), median OS was 8.5 mo (CI, 95%: 4.8-12.2) for ARM A, 8.2 mo (CI, 95%: 2.0-14.3) for ARM B, and 29.2 mo (CI, 95%: not yet evaluable) for ARM C. The  i ORR was 0%, 19.2% and 44.4% in ARM A, B, and C, respectively. The  i DCR was 26.1%, 34.6% and 55.6% in ARM A, B, and C, respectively. Median PFS was 3.0 mo (CI, 95%: 2.3-3.6), 3.3 mo (CI, 95%: 1.2-5.4), and 8.4 mo (CI,95%: 4.2-12.7), in ARM A, B, and C, respectively. Conclusions Unlike Ipi  plus  FTM, Ipi  plus  Nivo significantly ( p =0.009) improves the long-term survival of MM pts with BM, compared to FTM. Ipi  plus  Nivo should represent the treatment of choice in first line MM pts with BM. Clinical trial identification NCT02460068. Legal entity responsible for the study NIBIT Foundation.

This non-randomized phase I/II study evaluates the IDO/PD-L1 peptide vaccine in combination with nivolumab in patients with progressive metastatic melanoma. Here we report safety, efficacy, and immune response data. Methods Thirty treatment naive stage IV melanoma patients received a maximum of 15 IDO/PD-L1 vaccine doses SC (6x q2w followed by 9x q4w). Nivolumab (3 mg/kg) was administered every second week (q2w) until intolerable toxicity or tumor progression. The objectives were to assess safety, immune response in blood and biopsies as well as efficacy. Results As of the data cut-off, August 2020, all 30 patients were enrolled with a median follow up of 15 months. 1 patient is pending first evaluation, 29 were evaluated and by investigator review per RECIST v1.1 an overall response rate (ORR) of 79% was reached; ORR was 94% and 62% in PD-L1 positive and negative patients, respectively. At data cut-off, 45% have reached complete response and 34% partial response, which was significantly higher than a matched control group extracted from the DAMMED database receiving anti-PD-1 monotherapy treatment as standard of care. The median progression free survival (mPFS) was 25,6 months. Except for local reactions at vaccination site toxicity was comparable to patients receiving nivolumab monotherapy. Vaccine specific T-cells against either IDO and/or PD-L1 were detectable in PBMC from all treated patients and in a number of patients at the tumor site where a biopsy was feasible. Preliminary results from tumor immune contexture analyses were indicative for response. Conclusions The combination of IDO/PD-L1 peptide vaccine and nivolumab is safe with encouraging early efficacy data; an ORR of 79% was reached and 45% achieved complete response. Vaccine specific T-cells were demonstrated in PBMCs and tumor site.

The current pooled analysis addresses these key questions, including a 12-mo CR landmark analysis used to decrease the time guarantee bias. Methods In this post hoc analysis, 5-yr data were pooled from the phase III CheckMate 066 and 067 studies and the phase II CheckMate 069 study of pts with treatment-naive, advanced melanoma. Analyzed pts received either the approved regimen of NIVO+IPI followed by NIVO monotherapy or NIVO monotherapy. Characteristics and outcomes of pts with a CR (by RECIST) were investigated, including 12-mo landmark survival analyses to determine the likelihood of being alive at 5-y among pts in CR by 12 mo (to mitigate the time guarantee bias). Results Minimum follow-up was 60 mo since randomization of the last pt in each study; pooled median mo of follow-up was 63 for NIVO+IPI (n=409) and 64 for NIVO (n=526). CRs were demonstrated in 96 (23%) NIVO+IPI pts and 102 (19%) NIVO pts; of CR pts alive at 5 yrs, 75/79 (95%) and 85/91 (93%) had not received subsequent systemic therapy. Baseline characteristics significantly associated with CR (Table) were M stage (NIVO+IPI), PD-L1 \u2265 5% (NIVO), normal lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; both) and fewer disease sites (both). Median duration of CR and median time to subsequent systemic therapy were not reached in either group. Median mo (Q1, Q3) to CR was 9.1 (2.8, 23.1) for NIVO+IPI and 11.8 (5.8, 26.5) for NIVO alone. In pts in CR at 12-mo, 5-y OS for NIVO+IPI and NIVO respectively was 85% and 86%; PFS was 84% and 82%. Conclusions NIVO+IPI- or NIVO-treated pts in CR at 12 mo have a high likelihood of being alive at 5 y even without subsequent systemic therapy. Several baseline pt characteristics were associated with CR duration. Factors associated with CR may differ for NIVO+IPI and NIVO alone. Biomarker analyses are ongoing.

ILLUMINATE-204 was a phase 1/2 study of tilsotolimod with ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma following progression on or after anti-PD-1 therapy. Methods Adults with unresectable or metastatic melanoma that progressed on or after a PD-1 inhibitor, an accessible tumor for intratumoral administration of tilsotolimod, and \u2264 2 lines of prior therapy (\u2264 3 if BRAF-mutant) were eligible. Prior ipilimumab was allowed. Tilsotolimod was administered to a single tumor during weeks 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 11; ipilimumab was administered per the product label. The primary objective of the phase II portion was to assess preliminary clinical activity at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D). Results A total of 62 patients were treated with tilsotolimod in combination with ipilimumab. Of these, 52 received the RP2D of 8 mg, and 49 were evaluable for efficacy. The median OS was 21.0 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 9.8 - not reached [NR]), and the overall response rate per RECIST v1.1 was 22.4% (95% CI: 11.8 - 36.6), including 2 complete responses. Median duration of response was 11.4 months (95% CI: 3.3 - NR) with 7/11 responses lasting \u2265 6 months. The disease control rate was 71.4% (95% CI: 56.7 - 83.4). Tumor reduction was observed in injected and non-injected lesions. Analysis of biopsies showed rapid local IFN\u03b1 gene expression, dendritic cell maturation, and expansion of shared CD8+ T cell clones in injected and non-injected tumors. Grade \u2265 3 AEs were observed in 48% (30/62) of patients, most commonly increased ALT and AST and colitis, and 26% experienced immune-related AEs. No AEs led to treatment discontinuation or death. Conclusions Tilsotolimod with ipilimumab was generally well-tolerated and demonstrated efficacy in anti-PD-1-refractory advanced melanoma. Activity was observed in injected and non-injected lesions. A phase III study of this combination compared with ipilimumab alone (ILLUMINATE-301; NCT03445533) is ongoing. Clinical trial identification NCT02644967.

Camrelizumab, a humanized anti\u2013PD-1 antibody, had shown favorable anti-tumor activity and manageable toxicities in R/M NPC in previous phase I trial (Fang et al.  Lancet Oncol  2018). We conducted this phase II trial (CAPTAIN) to further assess the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab in R/M NPC. Methods Patients with histologically confirmed R/M NPC (stage IVb) who had progressed on \u22652 lines of chemotherapy were enrolled and received camrelizumab at 200 mg IV q2w. The primary endpoint was ORR assessed by independent review committee (IRC) per RECIST v1.1. Results From Aug 14, 2018 to Dec 30, 2019, 156 eligible patients were enrolled and received camrelizumab treatment. As of data cutoff on Mar 31, 2020, the median follow-up time was 9.2 months (range 0.7\u201319.1). Of the 156 patients, 44 (28.2%, 95% CI 21.3\u201336.0) patients had an objective response assessed by IRC, including one complete response and 43 partial responses. Median DoR was not reached (95% CI 7.4\u2013not estimable), and the 12-month DoR rate was 53.7% (95% CI 30.9\u201372.0). Median PFS per IRC was 3.7 months (95% CI 2.0\u20133.9) and median OS was 17.1 months (95% CI 15.2\u2013not estimable). Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) of any grade were observed in 151 (96.8%) of the 156 patients. TRAEs of \u22653 grade occurred in 22 (14.1%) patients, with the most common ones being increased gamma-glutamyl transferase (3.2%) and anaemia (3.2%). Treatment interruption and discontinuation due to TRAEs occurred in 18 (11.5%) and one (0.6%) patients, respectively. Seventeen (10.9%) patients had serious TRAEs, and one death was considered as drug-related. Plasma Epstein-Barr virus DNA and evaluable tumor samples for biomarker analysis were obtained and the result will be presented at the meeting. Conclusions Camrelizumab demonstrated promising anti-tumor activity and favorable safety profile in patients with R/M NPC who had progressed on \u22652 lines of chemotherapy, thus could represent a novel treatment option for this patient population.

It has been speculated that the routine use of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) further increases the risk of radiation-associated SPC, but long-term clinical data with reference to population cancer incidences are lacking. Methods This is a territory-wide multicentered study. Consecutive NPC patients (n=3166) who underwent definitive IMRT in all six public oncology centers in Hong Kong between 2001 and 2010 were included. SPC risks were quantified by standardized incidence ratios (SIR) and absolute excess risks (AER), estimated from age-, sex- and calendar year-specific population cancer incidence data from the Hong Kong Cancer Registry. Predictive factors for SPC occurrence were analyzed by Cox regression. SPC-specific mortality was estimated using competing risk model. Results With a median follow-up of 10.8 years, 290 SPCs were observed with a crude incidence of 9.2%. Cancer risk in NPC survivors was 90% higher than that in general population (SIR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.7\u20132.2), with an AER of 52.1 (95% CI, 36.8\u201367.3) per 10,000 person-years at risk. Significant excess cancer risks were observed for oral cavity (SIR, 26.3; 95% CI, 19.1\u201333.6), soft tissue or bone sarcoma (SIR, 15.2; 95% CI, 9.3\u201321.2), oropharynx (SIR, 11.4; 95% CI, 4.0\u201318.9), paranasal sinus (SIR, 8.6; 95% CI, 1.7-25.1), salivary gland (SIR, 6.8; 95% CI, 1.4-20.0), non-melanoma skin (SIR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.5\u20135.7), thyroid (SIR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.2\u20135.6) and lung (SIR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3\u20132.3). Advanced age, smoking, hepatitis B status and re-irradiation were independent predictive factors for SPC occurrence. SPC constituted 9.4% of all deaths during study period, the 5-year and 10-year SPC-specific mortality were 0.9% and 3.4% respectively. Median overall survival after SPC occurrence was 2.4 years. Conclusions Second cancer risk after IMRT for NPC was substantial within the irradiated head and neck regions. Relative risk of SPC after IMRT was comparable with historical reports in the conventional 2-dimensional radiotherapy era. SPC impairs long-term survival of NPC patients, close surveillance is warranted as part of survivorship care. Legal entity responsible for the study The authors.

Cumulative delivered dose of Cis is prognostic of survival, even beyond 200 mg/m 2  (P Strojan 2016) but high toxicity compromises its delivery. Fractionated dose of Cis allows decreasing the serum concentration peak and toxicity. No direct comparison was done of SOC vs. fractionated high dose Cis (FHD Cis) leading the GORTEC to conduct a randomized phase II. Methods The trial, stratified on postoperative or definitive CRT, compares SOC to FHD Cis (25 mg/m 2 /d d1-4 q3w (3 cycles)) concomitantly to definitive (70 Gy/7 weeks) or postoperative (66 Gy/6.5 weeks) RT. The primary endpoint was the cumulative delivered Cis dose. Results A total of 124 patients (pts) were randomized at 10 sites in France: 65 in SOC arm and 59 in FHD Cis arm .  Median age: 60, Male: 85%, ECOG 0: 50%, Stage IV: 77%, definitive CRT: 58%, oropharynx: 51% (p16+: 43%), smoking history 89% of pts (median of 40 pack-years), all well balanced between the 2 arms. The median cumulative Cis dose was 291 mg/m 2  (interquartile [IQ]: 256-298) for FHD Cis vs. 280 mg/m 2  (IQ: 199-295) for SOC (p=0.03). 84% of pts with FHD Cis received the third cycle of Cis vs. 67% with SOC (p=0.03). Overall, 50 (35%) grade III-IV acute toxicities occurred with FHD Cis vs. 91 (65%) with SOC (p<0.001) leading to 19 SAEs with FHD Cis vs. 32 with SOC, including one toxic death with pneumonitis and febrile neutropenia (p=0.07). With a median follow-up of 2.2 years (yrs) (0-3.4), the 2-yr loco-regional failure-free survival (LRFFS) was 61% with FHD Cis vs. 58% with SOC (hazard ratio [HR]=0.97, 95%CI: 0.54-1.74, p=0.91). The 2-yr progression-free and overall survival FHD Cis / SOC were: 54%/ 54% (HR=1.05, 95%CI: 0.60-1.81, p=0.87) and 69%/ 68% (HR=0.88, 95%CI: 0.48-1.66, p=0.67) respectively. Conclusions FHD Cis allowed significantly more Cis to be delivered, with significantly lower toxicity, when compared to SOC. LRFFS, PFS and OS were not significantly different between the two arms. FHD Cis concomitantly with RT is a treatment option which deserves further consideration. Clinical trial identification EudraCT: 2015-001928-29. Legal entity responsible for the study GORTEC Group.

Here we report initial safety and efficacy of the anti-PD-L1 durvalumab plus MEDI0457, a DNA immunotherapeutic vaccine expressing HPV 16/18 E6/E7 proteins and IL-12, in pts with HPV+ R/M HNSCC. Methods This phase Ib/IIa, open-label, multicenter study (NCT03162224) enrolled pts with incurable, histologically/cytologically confirmed R/M HPV+ HNSCC, who had \u22651 prior platinum-containing regimen or other approved therapy if platinum-ineligible. MEDI0457 at a dose of 7 mg IM (weeks 1, 3, 7, then Q8W after week 12) and durvalumab 1500 mg IV Q4W were given until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Primary objectives included safety and efficacy by objective response rate (ORR; RECIST v1.1). Exploratory endpoints included induction of antibodies and HPV-specific T cells peripherally. Tumor-infiltrating T cells were measured. Results In July 2017 to Aug 2019, 35 pts were enrolled. Most were male (97.1%) with oropharyngeal primary (82.9%); 31.4% had PD-L1 \u226525%. At the interim data cutoff (DCO; 22 Nov 2019), therapy was ongoing in 13 pts (37.1%) and 27 were response-evaluable. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 77.1% of pts, mostly of Grade 1\u20132 severity. Fatigue (37.1%) and injection site pain (34.3%) were most common. Five pts (14.3%) had Grade 3 TRAEs and 1 pt (2.9%) had 3 serious Grade 3 TRAEs (AST and ALT increased and myocarditis causing discontinuation). No pts had Grade 4/5 TRAEs. ORR was 22.2% with 3 complete responses (all ongoing at DCO) and 3 partial responses (2 ongoing at DCO). Peripheral HPV-specific T cells and tumoral CD8+ T cells were increased.

The objectives of the current study were to provide additional insights into the frequency of high-grade adverse events (AEs) related to N and the efficacy of N in real life. Methods From 08/2017 to 11/2018, 343 pts were treated in the multicenter phase II TOPNIVO. The main inclusion criteria were pts with platinum refractory R/M SCCHN, ECOG 0-2. Pts received N 3mg/kg every 2 weeks intravenously. We report safety and efficacy (OS, progression free survival (PFS), overall response rate (ORR)). Results Median age was 62 yr (73 pts \u2265 70 yr), 81% male, 85% ECOG 0-1, 15% ECOG 2. Cancer primary site was oropharynx 40%, oral cavity 24%, hypopharynx 20%, larynx 15%. 37% had loco regional (LR) relapse, 30% metastatic disease and 33% both. 51% had received one prior line of chemotherapy and 27% two prior lines before inclusion. Median number of N administrations was 6 (from 1 to 63). 233 pts (68%) experienced \u2265 1 AE grade \u22653. On the 434 AEs grade 3-4, 53 (mainly pneumopathy, lipase increase, endocrine disorders and asthenia) were related to N and occurred in 36 pts (10%). On the 89 AEs grade 5, 5 were considered related to N (3 pneumonitis, 1 hepatitis, 1 cardiac arrest). Median follow-up was 23.5 months (mo). 268 pts died. OS, PFS and ORR are reported in the table.

Molecular alterations can guide targeted therapeutics, but the value of comprehensive genomic/proteomic profiling to detect clinically relevant targeteable alterations (TA) as per ESCAT remains to be studied. Methods We analyzed all mSGT pts treated at VHIO phase I Unit from 2016 to 2019. Clinicopathological features, molecular alterations and treatment modalities were correlated with outcomes (objective response rates [ORR] and progression-free survival [PFS]). Clinical actionability of multigene panel testing (NGS) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) was defined as per ESCAT scale. Results In total 107 pts with baseline NGS were identified, median age was 56.7 years, 93 pts (86.9%) ECOG \u22641, primary tumor histology was adenoid cystic carcinoma in 47%, salivary duct carcinoma in 13%, myoepithelial carcinoma in 8%, other in 32%. Median number of treatment lines was 1.5 (range 0-10), median overall survival was 51.5 months (m) (95%CI 33.9-NA) and median follow-up 25.5 m. On IHC, HER2 overexpression in 7%, Androgen Receptor (AR) in 43% and Estrogen/Progesterone Receptor (ER/PR) in 12%. On NGS, PIK3CA mut in 7%, NOTCH1 mut in 6%, FGFR1-3 mut in 5%, NTRK fusion in 4%. Out of 11 samples with tumor mutation burden assessed, all were low (median=2.5 mut/Mb, range 0-5). According to ESCAT, 48 pts (45%) showed at least one TA and 29 (27%) were treated accordingly. In total, 20 ESCAT levels 1/2 therapies (1 NTRK, 6 HER2, 13 RA) and 13 ESCAT levels 3/4 therapies (2 RE/RP, 5 PIK3CA, 3 FGFR, 1 EGFR, 2 NOTCH) were tested. ORR was 30%, with a trend for higher ORR in level 1/2 vs. 3/4 (Odds ratio 9.8, p= 0.058). Median PFS on TA was 5 months (CI95% 3.45-19.04), not different as per ESCAT levels (3.4 months vs. 12.4 months, hazard ratio 0.6, p= 0.23). Conclusions In our cohort, molecularly-guided TA have promising activity in pts with mSGT. These results suggest that MGT and IHC tests are of potential value in selected populations. Response rates are higher with therapies matched to ESCAT level 1/2 alterations, but long-term disease control can also be achieved with more emerging actionability markers levels 3/4.

HRQoL was evaluated. Methods Pts aged \u226518 y, were post\u2212autologous stem cell transplant (auto-SCT) or ineligible for auto-SCT, measurable disease and ECOG PS 0 or 1 were randomized 1:1 to pembro 200 mg IV Q3W or BV 1.8 mg/kg IV Q3W. EORTC QLQ-C30 and EuroQoL EQ5D scales were protocol-specified exploratory end points administered electronically at baseline (BL) and Q6W up to wk 24 and Q12W thereafter. Analysis population included pts who received \u22651 dose of study treatment and completed \u22651 HRQoL assessment. Least-squares mean (LSM) changes from BL to prespecified wk 24 end point were calculated. Time to deterioration (TTD; \u226510-point decline from BL) was assessed by Kaplan-Meier. Differences evaluated using two sided p-values not controlled for multiplicity. Results 296 pts were included (pembro, 146; BV, 150). Completion and compliance rates were >90% for both groups at BL and remained high (>80%) at wk 24. Improvement was observed at wk 24 with pembro in the QLQ-C30 global health status/quality of life (GHS/QoL; LSM difference [95% CI]: 8.60 [3.89-13.31];  P =0.0004) and physical functioning (6.42 [1.87-10.62];  P =0.0054) scores vs BV, which showed a worsening. Similar improvements were seen for pembro in EQ5D utility (0.09 [0.04-0.14);  P =0.0004) and VAS scores (6.12 [1.91-10.34];  P =0.0046). Pembro demonstrated an improvement in QLQ-C30 GHS/QoL score vs BV in pts who progressed (11.76 [5.66-17.86];  P =0.0002) and did not progress (5.10 [\u20132.53, 12.73];  P =0.187). Prolonged TTD was observed with pembro vs BV for QLQ-C30 GHS/QoL (HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.22-0.74;  P =0.003) and physical functioning score (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.32-0.97;  P =0.034). Conclusions Among R/R cHL pts, pembro demonstrated improvement in HRQoL compared with BV, which showed a worsening. These data, along with statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in PFS, support pembro as new standard of care for pts who relapsed post auto-SCT or are ineligible for auto-SCT.

This study aims to evaluate the usage of PET-adapted strategies and the management of AEs in cHL patients receiving front line therapies in Italy (IT), Spain (SP), and Israel (IL). Methods At 28 sites in IT, SP and IL, medical records were abstracted for patients diagnosed between March 2014 and August 2018 with advanced cHL and treated with conventional 1L systemic therapies. Results The aggregate sample (N=256) comprised of patients with advanced- stage cHL, treated in 1L with ABVD (86.3%), AVD (2.7%), BEACOPPinitiation-based (8.6%), or other systemic therapy (2.3%), and distributed across IT (35.5%), SP (41.3%), and IL (23.2%). Median (range) age at initial cHL diagnosis was 39 (19 \u2013 91), males- 54.3%. Among 221 patients who received 1L ABVD (the most prevalent regimen type), 187 (84.6%) patients completed six cycles of therapy, 142 (66.6%) underwent interim PET2, of which 30.4% were positive, however few (n= 25, 17.6%) had PET-adapted modifications. A majority (89.1%) of patients received at least one supportive care product. AEs were more prevalent among older patients (>60 years). All grade neutropenia occurred in 47.1% of the patients receiving ABVD; the rate of febrile neutropenia was 6.8%. Other AEs included: infections (22.2%), anemia (27.6%), thrombocytopenia (2.7%). Cardiovascular or pulmonary complications occurred in 5 (2.3%) and 22 (10%) ABVD patients, respectively, 11 of whom had undergone PET2 assessment - 3 with treatment de-escalation. Conclusions Unmet needs exist with respect to the balance between therapeutic efficacy and safety risks of 1L chemotherapies in cHL. Even when PET2 scans are available to monitor tumour response, they are not always used to modify treatment management. Most patients continue to rely on supportive care products, or experience avoidable toxicities, underscoring the importance of new treatment combinations with novel agents.

This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of BV in RRcHL in the real-world. Methods Systematic review of observational studies and meta-analysis based on literature (MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science), pragmatic searches and snowballing (01/01/2010 \u2013 06/02/2020). Data of interest were patterns of BV use, treatment responses, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse events. Statistical heterogeneity assessed through I 2  statistics. Estimates pooled using a random effects model. Primary analysis included only studies of good methodological quality. Publication bias was assessed by a funnel plot. Sensitivity analyses included studies of moderate quality and estimates reported in abstracts. Results The literature search yielded 2,460 references and pragmatic searches found 21 additional ones. Upon abstract screening and in-depth review, eligibility was confirmed for 32 sources. In 26 sources, the dosing regimen of BV in RRcHL was 1.8 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Median number of cycles administered ranged from 4 to 8, uniformly distributed across studies. In real-world environment, the overall response rate (ORR) to BV based on the revised response criteria for malignant lymphoma ranged from 46.6% to 84.0% (28 sources) with 21.1% to 45.8% patients achieving complete response (26 sources). After 4 cycles, pooled estimate of ORR was 62.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 56.0 - 68.9; I 2  = 9.5%) while after 4-6 cycles, it was 66.7% (95% CI: 58.5 - 74.5; I 2  = 43.9%). Similar results were found in sensitivity analyses. The 1-year, 2-year and 5-year PFS ranged from 52.1% to 63.2% (2 sources), 45.2% to 56.2% (3 sources) and 31.9% to 33.0% (2 sources), respectively. The 1-year, 2-year and 5-year OS ranged from 68.2% to 82.7% (6 sources), 58.0% to 81.9% (7 sources) and 58.0% to 62.0% (2 sources), respectively. Conclusions The present study corroborates the effectiveness of BV in RRcHL patients managed in the real-world setting by showing results which are consistent with those of the pivotal phase II trial.

Given its low frequency, it is very difficult to design randomized studies, being the accumulated experience of academic groups a source of relevant information for the management of these patients. Methods 85 patients recruited by the Spanish Lymphoma Group of 12 hospitals have been retrospectively analysed describing their clinical and sociodemographic characteristics. Results The median follow-up was 16 years, with a 10-year OS of 92.9% and 81.2% at 20 years. 5 patients developed a second tumor. There is no transformation to more aggressive lymphoma. There was a 31% relapse, being 77% a single and supradiaphragmatic relapse. The percentage of progression to first-line treatment was: 50% in those under observation, 26% of those who received QT-RT, 27% of those who received only RT, and 47% of those who received CH exclusively. The mean time to relapse was 3 years and 47% presented relapses beyond 5 years (higher probability in stages IV p <0.001).

However, the use of IC may entail adverse reactions e.g., chills, nausea and shooting pain in the teeth, which will influence the tolerability and, thus, compliance. In addition, IC requires water of good quality to minimize risk of serious infections in already immunocompromised patients. To eliminate these adverse incidents, this study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of a novel intraoral cooling device (ICD) for cryoprevention of OM. Methods In total 182 patients with multiple myeloma or lymphoma, scheduled to receive high-dose chemotherapy prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, were included and randomly assigned (1:1) to cooling with IC or the ICD. Each cooling session started 30 minutes prior to the chemotherapy infusion and continued for 30 minutes after the infusion was completed. Patients were followed up for up to 28 days and OM was assessed employing the Oral Mucositis Assessment Scale (OMAS). The primary endpoint, peak OMAS, was analyzed by a multiple linear regression model with fixed explanatory variables, treatment group and type of cancer. Results When the entire patient material was analyzed for OMAS-total, the two cooling methods were equally effective, and severe OM was found to be below 10%. However, when the lymphoma group was analyzed separately, the ICD significantly reduced the OMAS-total score to a greater extent compared to IC (mean = 1.77 vs 3.08; p=0.047). Both diagnostic groups reported a higher degree of tolerability when ICD was compared with IC (OR=0.245; p<0.02). Conclusions Cryoprevention is an effective strategy to prevent chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis. The conventional cooling method of using ice was shown to be further improved by the use of the intraoral device both regarding the prevention of oral mucositis for specific diagnostic groups as well as for the reported tolerability.

In this study, we evaluate the safety and efficacy of AUTO3, a CAR T targeting CD19/22 with limited duration of PD-1 blockade. Methods We constructed a bicistronic retroviral vector encoding both an anti-CD19 (OX40 co-stim) and an anti-CD22 (41BB co-stim) CAR with humanized binders. The cell product was manufactured in a semi-automated and closed process using CliniMACS Prodigy. Patients (\u2265 18 years) with r/r DLBCL (NOS) or transformed (tDLBCL); ECOG < 2, adequate organ function are eligible. Lymphodepletion was Flu/Cy prior to AUTO3. Bridging therapy was allowed. The three dose levels explored are 50, 150, and 450 x 10 6  CAR T-cells. Patients received AUTO3 alone, or with 3 doses of pembrolizumab (pem) 200 mg q 3 wks starting on D14 (regimen A), or with a single dose of pem 200 mg on D-1 (regimen B). The primary endpoint is frequency of DLTs and grade (G) 3-5 adverse events (AE) and secondary endpoints included ORR, CRR, and biomarkers. Results As of April 27, 2020, 23 patients were treated with AUTO3 in the ongoing phase I study. The median age was 57 (28 - 83) and median number of prior therapies was 3 (2 - 10). 87% had refractory disease, 74% were DLBCL NOS, and 26% were tDLBCL. Dose escalation from 50 to 450 x 10 6  cells with pem regimen A and B have been completed without DLTs. G \u2265 3 treatment emergent AEs that occurred \u2265 25% were neutropenia (87%), thrombocytopenia (57%), and anemia (48%). Majority of Serious AE were hematological related and reversible. There were 0 cases of severe cytokine release syndrome (sCRS) or neurotoxicity (NT) of any grade at > 50 x 10 6  cells. Among the 16 patients treated at dose > 50 x 10 6 , the ORR was 69% and CRR was 56%, and all CRs are ongoing at a median f/u 3 months (1-12 months). Among the 8 patients treated at a dose > 50 x 10 6  with D-1 pem, the ORR was 75% and CRR was 63%. Additional data from patients treated at the recommended phase II dose as well as patients treated in an out-patient setting and longer follow up, as well as relevant biomarkers will be presented. Conclusions AUTO3 at > 50 x 10 6  CAR T cells with pembrolizumab induces CRs without severe CRS or NT of any grade. Clinical trial identification EudraCT Number: 2016-004682-11.

Progression of disease within 24 months after treatment (POD24) predicts overall survival (OS) in patients (pts) treated with rituximab-based therapy. Pts with POD24 have a < 50% long-term survival. Identifying predictors of POD24 at outset is an area of unmet need. Total metabolic tumor volume (TMTV) is an independent predictor of outcomes in FL. However, TMTV calculations are not routinely available, unlike SUVmax. Thus, we aimed at determining the correlation of baseline SUVmax with POD24 in FL. Methods We performed a retrospective chart review of pts with newly diagnosed FL from January 2011-January 2019. Comparison of PFS was done with log-rank test and multivariate analysis was conducted with Cox regression. Results 100 pts with median age 60 years (29-86 years) were included. Baseline characteristics are mentioned in the attached figure. 21% of pts relapsed within 24 months (POD24) however median OS was unable to be calculated due to insufficient OS events. Baseline PET-CT analysis showed median SUV max value of 8.55 (0-38.9). No difference in correlation was noted between baseline SUVmax and initial laboratory data collected (ANC, ALC, Hgb, Plt, LDH, albumin, and globulin). Median SUV max for POD24 pts was higher at 9.19 vs 7.40 for non-POD24 however, comparison of SUVmax by POD24 status showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups (p=0.95). T-test also failed to note a difference between baseline laboratory variables and PET-CT determinates (number of nodal and extranodal sites) between POD24 and non-POD24 pts. Conclusions In our analysis, baseline SUVmax did not predict POD24 nor were there significant differences in the comparison of clinical variables between the two POD24 groups. Gene-expression profiling (GEP) scores have been developed to predict PFS in FL and high-risk signatures have been found to react differently to different chemotherapy backbones. Future research efforts should focus on increasing the feasibility and adoption of GEP in clinical practice, defining molecular subtypes of FL prior to treatment, and assigning therapy on the basis of those results.

Methods Between January 2016 and January 2020, twelve patients with HIV-related lymphoma who have undergone ASCT were included in this prospective matched case-control study (study group, n=12). Forty eight non-HIV-infected patients were enrolled to the control group (n=48, 1:4). The median age was 34 (19-66) y.o. The underlying diseases in the study group were Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) n=7 (58,3%) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) n=5 (41,7%), complete remission at the moment of ASCT \u2013 66,7%. Conditioning regimen was BEAM with BCNU replacement by Bendamustine 160 mg/m2/day at D-7, D-6. HIV viral load was undetectable; the median number of CD4+ cells was 471,5 (210-715) cells/mcl; all patients were on anti-retroviral therapy (ART). The median follow up time was 16 (1-43) months. Results The 2-year overall survival (OS) (n=60) was 90%; 91,7% in the study group and 89,9% in the control group, and this was not significantly different between the groups ( P = 0,763). Progression-free survival (PFS) at 2 years in the study group was 75%, and was not significantly different to the control group (70,8%;  P =0,777). Time to progression (TTP) at 2 years was 14,6% in the study group and 16,7% in the control group ( P =0,643). Complete remission at the moment of ASCT improved PFS ( P  =0,03) and TTP ( P  =0,044) in the whole group. The median time for recovery of leukocytes, neutrophils, and platelets was D+14,5 (10-25), D+17 (12-30), D+15,5 (11-31), respectively, in the study group and D+14 (10-22), D+15 (10-23), D+15 (8-31) in the control group. Neutrophil recovery was significantly delayed in study group ( P =0,04). There was no difference in the rate of organ toxicity according to CTCAE. The transplant-related mortality (TRM) at 2 years was 8,3% in the study group and 6,2% in the control group ( P =0,8). Conclusions Two-year overall survival in patients with HIV-related lymphoma was 91.7%, PFS was 75%, TTP was 14,6% and TRM was 8,3% and did not differ significantly from the control group. Only neutrophil recovery was significantly delayed after ASCT in patients with HIV-related lymphoma. Our data provide further evidence that ASCT is a safe and effective approach for patients with HIV-related lymphoma. Legal entity responsible for the study The authors.

PD1 blockade was effective in patients (pts) with R/R PTCL in a retrospective study. However, the efficacy and safety of PD1 blockade with camrelizumab combined with anti-angiogenic drug apatinib remains undefined. Methods In this trial (NCT03701022), pts with histologically confirmed PTCL, ECOG performance status of 0\u20131, and measurable lesion(s) by the Lugano 2014 criteria; those who aged 18 years or more; and those who previously received chemotherapy were eligible. PTCL included not-otherwise-specified PTCL (PTCL NOS), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL), and extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma nasal type (ENKTL). All pts received camrelizumab 200 mg every 2 weeks and apatinib 500 mg once a day with a cycle of 28 days until the evaluation of disease progression, unaccepted toxicity, withdrawal, or death. Response to treatment was evaluated with computed tomography images by the Lugano 2014 criteria. The objective response rate (ORR) was the primary endpoint, and progression-free survival (PFS) was the secondary endpoint. Results A total of 15 pts were enrolled by May 1, 2020, including four pts with PTCL NOS, four pts with AITL, two pts with ALCL, and five pts with ENKTL. The median age was 56 years, 10 pts were male, and the number of previous chemotherapy regimens was 1\u20136 with a mean of 3. Among 11 pts with evaluable results, 36.4% achieved ORR, including one patient with complete response (CR) and three pts with partial response (PR). Three pts were evaluated with stable disease. Pts with ALCL and ENKTL had more clinical benefits compared with other subtypes; all pts with ALCL and two of three pts with evaluable ENKTL had remission (one CR and three PR). The median PFS was 5.47 months (range 0.97\u20137.37 months). Most adverse events (AEs) were of grade 1 to 2, and AEs of grade 3 included thrombocytopenia (10.1%), neutropenia (4.5%), hypertension (4.5%), and rash (4.5%). No grade 4 or higher AEs were observed. Conclusions Camrelizumab combined with apatinib showed high activity and safety, and might be a feasible option for pts with R/R PTCL. Clinical trial identification NCT03701022.

Adding olaparib to maintenance bev after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy + bev led to a statistically significant progression-free survival (PFS) benefit in pts with advanced HGOC (hazard ratio 0.59; 95% confidence interval 0.49\u20130.72;  P <0.001) (Ray-Coquard  et al.

We explored ORR for pts with residual disease in PAOLA-1. Methods Pts with no evidence of disease or clinical complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) after platinum-based chemotherapy + bev received olaparib tablets (300 mg bid for up to 24 months) + bev (15 mg/kg q3w for 15 months in total) or placebo + bev. In pts with evidence of disease (target and/or non-target lesions) and/or cancer antigen-125 (CA-125) \u22652 x upper limit at baseline (assessment following initial therapy), we explored ORR according to GCIG criteria (Rustin  at al.

Results of O+D in gBRCAm PSR OC have been presented. MEDIOLA (NCT02734004) then evaluated combining O+D (doublet cohort) or O+D+B (triplet cohort) in non-gBRCAm PSR OC. Here we present initial results. Methods Pts had confirmed non-gBRCAm PSR OC and had progressed after receiving 1\u20132 prior lines (L) of platinum-based chemotherapy. Pts received O 300 mg bid and D 1.5g IV q4 weeks (w) and B 10 mg/kg q2w (triplet only) until progressive disease. Tumours were assessed by RECIST v1.1 at baseline and q8w. Primary endpoints were safety and 24-w disease control rate (DCR). Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), median duration of response (mDOR) and progression-free survival (PFS). Results From Nov 2018 to Feb 2019, 32 pts (69% 2 nd  L) enrolled and received O+D; from May 2018 to Jan 2019, 31 (68% 2 nd  L) enrolled and received O+D+B. At the data cut-off 13 Feb 2020, 22% of O+D and 42% of O+D+B pts remained on treatment. The most common grade \u22653 AEs in O+D were anaemia, lipase increased and neutropenia and anaemia, hypertension, fatigue, lipase increased, and neutropenia in O+D+B. Two (6%) and five (16%) pts discontinued one or more study drug due to an AE in O+D and O+D+B, respectively. Efficacy is summarized in the table. Efficacy in biomarker subgroups, including by presence of genome-wide loss of heterozygosity, will be presented.

Conclusions Combining O+D and O+D+B was well tolerated in pts with non-gBRCAm PSR OC, consistent with the known safety profiles of the single agents. The DCR for the doublet cohort did not meet the prespecified target of 80%. The 95% CI for DCR in the triplet cohort included the prespecified target of 80%. ORR and PFS in the triplet cohort demonstrate promising activity in non-gBRCAm PSR OC, and in this group the ORR and PFS are higher than reported for single-agent PARP or VEGF inhibitors.

The modeled CA-125 kinetic parameter (KELIM) is an indicator of chemosensitivity, and is associated with survival ( Clin Cancer Res  2019 & 2020;  JNCI CS  2020). The objective was to assess the role of KELIM regarding the probability of long progression-free survivorship (PS) > 5 years after 1st line treatment. Methods The datasets from 3 phase III trials in adjuvant setting (AGO-OVAR 9; AGO-OVAR 7 and ICON 7) were analyzed to explore the prognostic role of KELIM regarding the probability of PS in 2,868 stage (st) I-IV patients. An independent population-based cohort of 1,582 st II-IV patients in neo-adjuvant setting from The Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR) was used as a validation dataset. Results Of 2,868 patients in the learning set (median 45-month follow-up), 82 patients (2.8%) were PS: 48 st I-II (PS probability (PSp) = 9.5%); 32 st III (PSp = 1.6%); 2 st IV (PSp = 0.5%). With favorable KELIM > 0.06 days-1, PSp increased to 12.0% for st I-II, 2.9% for st III & 2.1% for st IV. In multivariable logistic regression, higher FIGO stage (st I-II reference; st III, OR = 0.18 and st IV: OR = 0.06) and KELIM (OR = 2.35 [1.51-3.59]) were predictors of PS. Of 1,582 patients in the NCR dataset (median 95-month follow-up), 36 patients (2.7%) were PS: 2 st II (PSp = 22.2%); 26 st III (PSp = 2.8%); 8 st IV (PSp = 1.2%). With favorable KELIM, PSp increased to 5.4% for st III, and 2.4% for st IV. In multivariable regression, completeness of interval debulking surgery (OR = 6.25 [2.40-21.41]) and KELIM (OR = 3.82 [1.49-9.65]) were predictors of PS. PSp was 12% for st III with favorable KELIM and complete surgery. In an explorative set with 509 patients, the KELIM prognostic impact was more marked in BRCA wild-type and BRCA1 mutated patients, than in BRCA2. Conclusions KELIM is an independent prognostic factor of progression-free survivorship > 5 years after 1st line treatment. The PSp is doubled in patients with favorable KELIM. The respective impacts of chemosensitivity and surgery relative to chance of potential cure are better understood. Legal entity responsible for the study The authors.

This benefit seems to be limited to patients with complete cytoreduction. The reason for limited outcome in patients with suboptimal surgery could be residual disease, peri-operative characteristics or tumor biology. While TFST is an often-used parameter in oncologic trials, its role in surgical trials is not defined. Methods Analysis of characteristics of surgery and systemic treatment, surgical complications, and tumor biology as predictive and prognostic factors. For this analysis, patients were splitted into 3 subgroups: (1) Control arm vs (2) surgical arm but no complete resection vs (3) surgical arm and complete resection. Results Group 1 included 201 patients, group 2 included 65 of (46 with documented tumor residuals after surgery, 16 without surgery, 3 without data about residuals) and group 3 included 141 patients. The use of platinum-based chemotherapy was 90% in group 1 vs 83.1% in group 2 and 91.5% in group 3. The use of bevacizumab was about 23% and PARP-inhibitors in < 10% in all groups. Median duration of surgery was 204 minutes in group 2 and 230 minutes in group 3. Time from randomization to start of systemic therapy was 15 days in group 1 vs 51 and 53 days in group 2 and 3, respectively. The re-laparotomy rate was about 3% in group 2 and 3. 30-day mortality rate was 0 in all arms. TFST in the surgical arm was significantly longer compared to the non-surgical arm (16.0 vs 21.3 months; p<0.001). TFST in group 1 vs 2 vs 3 was 16.0 vs 16.1 vs 26.3 months, respectively (p<0.001). Conclusions Suboptimal surgery seems to have similar burden as complete resection. Therefore, preoperative selection in an experienced Gynecologic Oncology center is indicated to avoid suboptimal debulking. TFST is prolonged substantially by complete resection.

Given that PD-1/PD-L1i exhibit only modest activity as monotherapy against MSS endometrial cancer (EC), we evaluated whether the combination of the PARPi talazoparib and the PD-L1i avelumab would demonstrate promising activity and acceptable toxicity in that setting. Methods We conducted a single-arm phase 2 study to evaluate avelumab and talazoparib in recurrent MSS EC (MSS determined by IHC). Eligibility criteria included measurable disease, no limit on prior therapies, and all EC histologies including carcinosarcomas. Co-primary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST 1.1 and progression-free survival rate at 6 months (PFS6). Talazoparib 1mg PO daily and avelumab 10 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks were administered until progression or unacceptable toxicity. A two-stage design was employed to allow for early stopping for futility. In the 1st stage, 16 pts were enrolled; if there were \u22652 ORs or \u22652 PFS6 responses, accrual would continue to the 2nd stage with enrollment of 19 additional pts. Overall, if there were \u22654 ORs or \u22658 PFS6 responses, avelumab+talazoparib would be considered worthy of further study. Results As of June, 5th 2020, 35 pts initiated therapy. Three pts exhibited OR [3PRs, ORR 8.6% (95% CI 1.8%-23.1%)] and 8 exhibited PFS6 responses (PFS6 responses by histology: 3 endometrioid, 3 serous, 1 clear cell and 1 carcinosarcoma), 5 ongoing. PFS at 6 months was 25.8% (95% CI 12.4%-41.4%) and median PFS was 3.65 months (95% CI: 2.4-5.4 months). Most common G3+ treatment-related toxicities were anemia (n=16, 45.7%), thrombocytopenia (n=10, 28.6%) and neutropenia (n=4, 11.4%). Seven (20%) pts had dose reductions; no pt discontinued therapy because of toxicity. Conclusions Avelumab and talazoparib met the predetermined PFS6 response criterion to be considered worthy of further evaluation in this pt population of recurrent MSS EC.

GARNET is a phase I study assessing antitumor activity and safety of dostarlimab monotherapy in pts with solid tumors. Methods This multicenter, open-label, single-arm study includes dose escalation and expansion parts. Here we report on 2 independent expansion cohorts of pts with recurrent or advanced EC (dMMR EC and MMRp EC, determined by immunohistochemistry [IHC]) that progressed on or after a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen. Pts received 500 mg dostarlimab IV Q3W for 4 cycles, then 1000 mg Q6W until disease progression, discontinuation, or withdrawal. The primary endpoints are objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) by blinded independent central review using RECIST v1.1. Results In total, 126 dMMR and 145 MMRp pts identified by IHC were enrolled and dosed. Of these, 103 and 142 pts had sufficient follow-up time (24 wks) for efficacy analyses, respectively. dMMR ORR was 44.7%; MMRp ORR was 13.4% (Table). Median DOR and OS were not reached. The most common grade \u22653 TEAEs (N=271) were anemia (12.2%), abdominal pain (4.8%), and dyspnea (4.1%). The most common grade \u22653 immune-related TEAEs were diarrhea, aspartate aminotransferase increased, and alanine aminotransferase increased (1.8% each). There were no treatment-related deaths. Conclusions Dostarlimab demonstrated durable antitumor activity in both dMMR and MMRp advanced/recurrent EC. dMMR status by IHC was associated with a higher response rate. No new safety signals were detected. These cohorts are the largest prospective evaluation of a PD-(L)1 therapy in EC to date.

However few data are available with tyrosine kinase inhibitors if progression during bevacizumab maintenance. Methods TAPAZ is a French randomized (2:1) phase II trial including recurrent OC pts during the first year of bevacizumab maintenance therapy in 1 st  or 2 nd  line, comparing weekly paclitaxel 65 mg/m 2  with pazopanib 600 to 800 mg daily (PP arm) to weekly paclitaxel 80mg/m 2  (P arm). Primary endpoint was Progression-Free-Survival (PFS). Main secondary endpoints were Overall Survival (OS), safety, pharmacokinetic, and Quality of Life (QoL). Results 116 pts were enrolled, 79 in PP and 37 in P arms. Median age was 65 y [42-85], relapse < 6months (mo) 70%, serous histology 88%, FIGO III/IV 98%. With a median follow-up of 12.8 mo [1-47], median PFS was 4.6 mo [3.9-6.1] in PP arm vs 5.5 mo [4.8-7.3] in P arm (p=0.6) and OS 13.5 vs 12.8 mo, respectively (p=0.77). Weekly median dose of Paclitaxel was 65 mg/m 2  in PP arm and 80 mg/m 2  in P arm. 14% of pts in PP arm received 800 mg of daily Pazopanib. 81% of pts in P arm stopped treatment because of progression vs 66% (p =0.09). G3/4 toxicities were more frequent in PP arm (87% vs 70%, p=0.03). Treatments discontinuation for toxicity was 47% in PP arm (including the 2 drugs in 19%) vs 12% in P arm (p<0.001). In PP arm, discontinuation was mainly due to digestive (31%), vascular (thrombosis, HBP) (28%) and hematologic (17%) disorders, with 3 sepsis and 2 toxic deaths (pulmonary embolism and digestive perforation). More significant deterioration of global QoL and diarrhea at 4 mo was reported in PP arm (mean change: -9 [-14; -3], p=0.003 and 11 [2-19], p=0.01, respectively). In PP arm, PFS and OS were not related to pazopanib plasma exposure at cycle 1 (p=0.7 and 0.5) but pts experiencing vomiting at cycle 1 had higher pazopanib exposure (p=0.01). Conclusions Addition of pazopanib to paclitaxel in recurrent OC pts progressing during bevacizumab maintenance is not superior to paclitaxel. It increases toxicity and compromises chemotherapy efficacy leading to more frequent early treatment discontinuations.

We report on the efficacy of subsequent chemotherapy at the time of disease progression. Methods First subsequent treatment was analysed in pts who progressed according to RECIST1.1 in the O and placebo (P) arms. We conducted a post-hoc analysis of time to second progression (TTSP) calculated from the date of RECIST progression after O maintenance to next progression or death as a surrogate of first post-olaparib treatment progression-free survival. Results 106/195 (54%) and 80/99 (81%) pts had a RECIST progression in the O and P arms respectively. Pt baseline demographics were balanced between both arms .  Overall, 161/186 (87%) pts received a first subsequent therapy, including a chemotherapy in 150/161 (93%) and a PARP inhibitor in 29/161 (18%, all in the P arm). In the P arm, 33/75 (44%) and 42/75 (56%) pts received a non-platinum and a platinum-based chemotherapy respectively vs 32/86 (37%) and 54/86 (63%) in the O arm. Overall, in pts receiving subsequent treatment, TTSP was longer in the placebo compared to the O arm: 11.1 vs 7 months (HR 1.93; 95% CI [1.35-2.76]). TTSP was 14.3 vs 7m with platinum-based chemotherapy and 8.3 vs 5.5m with non-platinum chemotherapy in the P and O arm respectively. Conclusions In this SOLO2 post-hoc comparison, some degree of resistance to standard subsequent platinum and non-platinum chemotherapy is noted in the O arm. However, the TTSP reduction being not at the expense of overall survival, it suggests that the earlier use of O remains optimal in this population. The best post O management should be studied in prospective manner. Clinical trial identification NCT01874353. Legal entity responsible for the study AstraZeneca. Funding AstraZeneca. Disclosure J-S.

We investigated the effect of Vel + chemotherapy followed by Vel maint on HRQoL in this population. Methods A phase III study (NCT02470585) examined efficacy of Vel (150 mg oral BID) plus carboplatin/paclitaxel (CP) for 6 cycles followed by maint with Vel 300/400 mg ( Vel-throughout ) or placebo (pbo) ( Vel-comb only ) or pbo with CP followed by pbo maint ( CP alone ). HRQoL measures were the NCCN Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Ovarian Symptom Index-18 (NFOSI-18) and the EuroQoL-5D-5L. HRQoL was measured at screening, Cycle 1 Day 1, and every other cycle until discontinuation. Exploratory analysis included on-treatment comparisons of mean change from baseline (BL) in HRQoL scores and median time to symptom worsening (TSW) across the primary study arms,  Vel-throughout  and  CP alone . Results This analysis included 1069 pts ( Vel-throughout  n=351,  Vel-comb only  n=363,  CP alone  n=355). HRQoL score improvements from BL were observed across both study arms. Smaller, non-statistically significant improvements in the  Vel-throughout  vs  CP alone  arms were noted for most domains, except NFOSI-18 Treatment Side Effects (TSE) where negative mean changes in the initial 7 cycles (indicating higher treatment burden) followed by improvements in later cycles were seen in both arms. TSW was not significantly different between the arms for any NFOSI-18 domain. Median TSW (months) for  Vel-throughout  vs  CP alone  was 10.5 vs 10.1 for \u2018disease-related symptom\u2019 and 8.1 vs 8.1 for \u2018functional well-being\u2019 domains. Conclusions Compared to CP alone, addition of Vel to CP followed by Vel maint showed smaller improvements in HRQoL scores from baseline. While early differences in TSE changes were noted, improvements were observed across both study arms in later cycles. TSW for HRQoL domains were similar across study arms. Thus, the addition of Vel to CP followed by Vel maint does not substantially affect HRQoL compared to CP alone. Clinical trial identification NCT02470585.

Here we report PROs in pts receiving niraparib and placebo (PBO) in the PRIMA/ENGOT-OV26/GOG-3012 trial. Methods This double-blind, PBO-controlled, phase III study randomized 733 pts with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer with a complete or partial response (CR or PR) to first-line (1L) platinum-based CT. Pts received niraparib or PBO once daily for 36 months or until disease progression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review. PROs, a secondary endpoint, were collected every 8 weeks for 56 weeks, then every 12 weeks thereafter while treatment was ongoing. Once a pt discontinued treatment, PRO evaluations were performed at the time of treatment discontinuation and then at 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks (\u00b11 week for each time point) after the end of treatment, regardless of the status of subsequent treatment. The validated PRO instruments utilized were FOSI, EQ-5D-5L, EORTC-QLQ-C30, and EORTC-QLQ-OV28. Results Compliance rates were high for all of the PRO instruments used in the study. PRO analysis of the EORTC-QLQ-C30 and EORTC-QLQ-OV28 did not indicate a difference in health-related quality of life scores of pts treated with niraparib vs placebo. Mean scores between niraparib and placebo arms were similar at each time point. Overall, the health utility index showed a slight improvement trend in pts who received niraparib vs placebo. Conclusions Consistent with PRO results in the NOVA study, pts receiving niraparib in the PRIMA trial did not experience a decrease in quality of life compared with those receiving placebo.

CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio; NR, not reachedThe safety profile of olaparib was consistent with previous observations. No new cases of myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukaemia were reported and incidence of new primary malignancies remained balanced between arms (olaparib, 7/260 [3%]; pbo, 5/130 [4%]).                                                                                               Conclusions For pts with a BRCAm and newly diagnosed advanced OC the benefit derived from 2 y of maintenance olaparib was sustained beyond the end of treatment and after 5 y almost half of pts were progression-free vs 20% with pbo. Over 50% of pts in CR after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy remained free from relapse 5 y later. 5-y f/u is the longest for any PARP inhibitor in this setting and no new safety signals were observed.

NEJM  2019); PFS2 was immature. Here, we report final PFS2 data from PAOLA-1. Methods Pts with newly diagnosed, FIGO stage III -IV HGOC in response after platinum-based chemotherapy plus bev randomized to olaparib tablets (300 mg bid for 24 months) + bev (15 mg/kg q3w for 15 months) or placebo + bev. PFS2 and time to second subsequent therapy or death (TSST) were key secondary endpoints (final PFS2 analysis planned for \u224853% data maturity or 1 year after primary analysis). Results 537 pts were randomized to olaparib + bev and 269 to placebo + bev with median PFS2 follow-up of 35.5 and 36.5 months, respectively (data cut-off 22 March 2020). Olaparib + bev provided a statistically significant reduction in the risk of second progression or death vs placebo + bev (ITT analysis; HR 0.78; 95% CI 0.64 -0.95;  P =0.0125) (Table). HRs for PFS2 by biomarker status with olaparib + bev vs placebo + bev were 0.53 in pts with a tumour BRCA mutation (tBRCAm), 0.56 in HRD-positive pts, 0.60 in HRD-positive pts without a tBRCAm and 1.04 in HRD-negative pts. TSST was longer with olaparib + bev vs placebo + bev (median 38.2 vs 31.5 months) (HR 0.78; 95% CI 0.64 -0.95;  P =0.0115). 49/537 (9%) olaparib + bev pts and 72/269 (27%) placebo + bev pts received a PARP inhibitor as first subsequent therapy. No new safety signals were seen with longer follow-up.

Methods In this multicentre case-control study, g BRCA2  carriers were matched 1:2 to known non-carriers (NC) by Gleason score and stage at diagnosis (M0 vs M1). A minimum of 60 cases-120 controls were required to prove a 5yrs cause-specific survival (CSS) rate of 60% vs 85%. The primary aim was to confirm the independent prognostic role of g BRCA2  in PC CSS. Secondary aims included to explore the clinical impact of somatic events in  BRCA2 ,  RB1 ,  MYC ,  PTEN  and  TMPRSS2-ERG  by FISH. Kaplan Meier and Cox-regression models were used to identify associations between molecular characteristics and outcomes. Results A total of 73 g BRCA2  carriers and 127 NC were eligible. g BRCA2  carriers were younger at diagnosis (p=0.02) and had more often T3/4 (p<0.001) than NC, but no other significant differences were found. g BRCA2  carriers presented more somatic alterations than NC (p<0.001), including  BRCA2  loss,  RB1  loss and  MYC  amplification.  BRCA2  were frequently co-deleted with  RB1  (Pearson correlation 0.96; p=0.001). g BRCA2  mutations were independently associated with CSS (HR 3.70; p=0.008).

CBZ was recently shown to improve overall survival (OS) in this population, though benefit by DDR status is unknown. We assessed CBZ activity in men with mCRPC according to their DDR status. Methods In this retrospective multicenter study, mCRPC patients (pts) who received CBZ were included if their DDR profile from tissue was available. Gene panels included at least  BRCA1/2, ATM, CDK12 CHEK1/2, FANCA/FANCL, PALB2, RAD51 . DDR positive (DDR+) pts could have had any deleterious germline or somatic DDR. For each DDR+ pts, DDR negative (DDR-) pts were randomly selected after matching for the same molecular test and institution, in a 1:1 ratio. PSA decline, radiological progression-free survival (rPFS) and OS were assessed. Results A total of 190 pts were included: 95 DDR+ and 95 DDR-. DDR+ pts were younger than DDR- (66 vs 69 years, p=0.026). The Gleason score was \u22658 in 66% and 55%, metastases (mts) were found at diagnosis in 51% and 41%, respectively. At CBZ start, pts had received a median of 2 prior life-prolonging agents, visceral mts in 24% and 26%, ECOG \u22641 in 78% and 80%, and a median PSA of 91 and 77 ng/ml, respectively. Among DDR+ pts, 40 (42%) had BRCA defects and 43 (45%) received a PARPi. A 50% PSA decline was achieved with CBZ in 29 (32%) and 33 (36%) in DDR+ and DDR- pts (p=0.64). Median rPFS was 5.33 months [95%CI 4.34-7.04] and 5.75 months [95%CI 4.67-7.27] (p=0.55), and median OS was 15.4 months [95%CI 12.16-26.6] and 11.5 months [95%CI 9.76-14.4] (p=0.036), respectively. An ECOG\u22652 and visceral mts were independently associated with shorter OS. Outcomes of DDR+ pts are depicted in the Table, according to their sequence with PARPi.

Current screening guidelines suggest the use of PSA only among  BRCA2  carriers. Female carriers have extensive guidelines that include imaging. Our objective was to test the prevalence of PCa among  BRCA  carriers and examine screening strategies, using PSA and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI). Methods We recruited men aged 40\u201370 with  BRCA1/2  germline mutations and no prior history of prostate biopsy. All men underwent an initial round of screening which included PSA, and prostate mpMRI. PSA was considered elevated using an age stratified threshold of \u22651ng/mL for 40-50Y, \u22652ng/mL for 50-60Y, and 2.5ng/mL for 60-70Y. Men with elevated PSA and/or suspicious lesion on mpMRI were offered a biopsy. PSA levels, MRI findings, PCa incidence, and tumor characteristics were evaluated. Decision curve analysis was used to compare screening strategies. Results We recruited 188 men (108 BRCA1, 80 BRCA2), mean age 54Y (\u00b19.8). One hundred and ten (57%) had either elevated age-stratified PSA (75; 40%), a suspicious MRI lesion (67; 36%), or both (32; 17%). Of these, 92 (85%) agreed to agreed to a biopsy. Sixteen (8.5%) were diagnosed with PCa; 44% of tumors were classified as intermediate or high risk. mpMRI based screening missed only one of the cancers (6%), while age stratified PSA would have missed five (31%). Decision curve analysis showed that mpMRI screening regardless of PSA had the highest net benefit for PCa diagnosis, especially among men younger than 55Y. We found no difference in the risk of PCa between BRCA1 and BRCA2 (8.3% vs. 8.7%, p=0.91).

A phase 1b/2 clinical study is being conducted to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and evaluate the preliminary efficacy in men with progressive mCRPC resistant to androgen blocking agents +/- a taxane. Methods Phase 1b study was a 3x3 design with escalating oral dosing of 4.5 mg to 81 mg (7 days on drug/14 days off per 21 day cycle). After no dose limiting toxicity was observed, the dose was increased in the next cohort. The schedule was also expanded in those completing the 7 days on/14 days off cycle to continuous dosing/cycle. Results 30 taxane-na\u00efve mCRPC men with a median age of 76 (61-92) were enrolled. 8 received prior enzalutamide, 12 abiraterone and 10 both. 8 men had bone mets, 5 lymph node, 5 mixed and 1 had soft tissue metastases. The MTD of VERU-111 is 72mg (3 /11 men had Grade 3 diarrhea). No Grade 3 diarrhea was observed at doses <72 mg per day. At doses < 72mg/d, the most common AEs were mild to moderate nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fatigue, with no observed neurotoxicity or neutropenia. Antitumor activity was assessed by PSA and bone/CT scans in men that were treated for \u2265 4 continuous 21-day cycles. 5/8 (63%) had PSA declines: 4 (50%) men had \u2265 30% and 2(25%) \u2265 50% declines compared to their 21 day cycle baseline. Based on PCWG3/RECIST 1.1 criteria, objective tumor responses were seen in 2 men (soft tissue and bone) and 5/8 (63%) had stable disease. Objective responses and PSA declines lasted > 12 weeks. Median duration of response has not been reached as 7/8 of the men are still being treated on study with a current duration of 10 months (6-15 months) and three additional men have not yet completed \u2265 4 continuous 21-day cycles. Conclusions The phase 1b portion demonstrates that oral VERU-111 has a favorable safety profile allowing for chronic administration and significant/durable antitumor activity. The daily dose of 63mg is being tested in the phase 2 portion. Oral administration, safe long-term treatment and evidence of antitumor activity highlight a potential prominent role of VERU 111 for the treatment of men with mCRPC who failed an androgen blocking agent.

Many observational studies suggested that using MET was associated with improvement in overall survival in PCa patients. MET was reported to be associated with reduction of risk of development of castration-resistant state (CRPC). In addition, when MET was combined to ADT or biclutamide, it augmented the antiproliferative effect of these drugs. Methods                       ( MANSMED) is a prospective randomized controlled trial. We randomly assigned high risk localized or mHSPC patients to receive standard of care (SOC) (androgen deprivation plus biclutamide 50mg) plus metformin (850 mg twice daily) or SOC alone. Primary end point was time to castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Secondary endpoint was overall survival (OS) and PSA response rate. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT03137186. Results a total of 124 men were randomly allocated into two arms (62 in MET arm, 62 in SOC arm). The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were comparable between two arms. Over a median follow up of 18 months, there were 12 deaths in the MET arm versus 17 deaths in the control arm (P= 0.2). Median time to CRPC was longer in MET arm 29 months (95%CI 25-33) compared to control arm 20 months (95% CI 16-24) (P=0.01). After subgroup analysis, the median time to progression to CRPC was longer at MET arm in high risk localized prostate cancer (P=0.02), in mHSPC patients with low tumor volume was of borderline significance (P= 0.06), and in those with node positive (N1) disease was highly significant (P=0.001). While in patients with high tumor volume, there was no significant difference regarding the median time to CRPC among the two groups (P=0.9). Regarding secondary objective, there was no significant difference between two arms in overall survival (OS) (P= 0.1) or PSA response rate (P=0.5). Notably no significant adverse events were reported in MET arm apart of self-limiting diarrhea. Conclusions Metformin potentially lengthen time to CRPC in advanced PCa patients when combined with ADT especially in those with high risk localized PCa, clinically node positive and in those with low tumor volume metastatic hormone naive patients.

The role of radical local therapy (RLT) to the primary tumor for these patients is unclear. We conducted this phase 2 randomized trial to investigate if radical prostatectomy (RP) or prostate radiotherapy (RT) benefits these patients (NCT02742675). Methods Oligo-metastases was defined as \u2264 5 bone or extra-pelvic lymph node metastases and no visceral metastases. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) or ADT plus RLT. For patients allocated to ADT+RLT group, RP was recommended with priority, while RT was administrated to those refused RP and those with unresectable primary tumor after 1-3 months induced ADT.

Results A total of 200 patients were enrolled between Sept 1, 2015 and Mar 10, 2019. The median age was 68 years and the median PSA at diagnosis was 98.8 ng/ml. Bone metastases and distant lymph node metastases exited in 96% and 15% of all patients. 96 of 100 patients in ADT+RLT group received RLT including 85 RP and 11 RT. After a median follow-up of 28 months, radiographic progression was observed in 19 of 100 patients in ADT+RLT group and 33 of 100 patients in ADT group. The median rPFS was not reached in ADT+RLT group and 50 months in ADT group (HR = 0.50; 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.87; p = 0.015). RLT related complications occurred in 24 of 85 RP patients (including 3 grade 3-4 complications) and 5 of 11 RT patients. In order to evaluate the OS, longer follow-up period is required. Conclusions Local therapy to the primary tumor improves rPFS in patients with newly diagnosed, oligo-metastatic prostate cancer. Clinical trial identification NCT02742675.

This trial evaluates the addition of trastuzumab (tras) and pertuzumab (per) to FLOT for HER2-positive patients (pts). Methods PETRARCA is a multicenter, randomized, investigator initiated trial planned as a phase II/III study. We report the phase II part of this trial. Pts with HER2+ resectable EGA (\u2265 cT2 or cN+) were randomized 1:1 to 4 pre- and post-operative cycles of FLOT (Docetaxel 50 mg/m 2 ; Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m 2 ; Leucovorin 200 mg/m 2 ; 5-FU 2600 mg/m 2 , q2w) (Arm A) or the same regimen with tras 8/6 mg/kg and per 840 mg q3w, followed by 9 cycles tras/per (arm B). Primary endpoint for the phase II part was the rate of pathological complete remission (pCR). Main secondary endpoints were DFS, OS and safety. Results The trial closed prematurely and did not proceed to phase III. In total, 81 pts were randomized (A, 41; B, 40). Baseline characteristics were balanced (overall, male 79%; median age 60; cT3/T4 86%; cN+ 85%; GEJ 75%). 93% in arm A and 90% in arm B completed pre-OP treatment as planned. More pts had at least one dose modification in arm B (A, 44%; B, 70%). pCR rate was significantly improved with tras/per (A, 12%; B, 35%; p = 0.02). Likewise, the rate of pathological lymph node negativity was higher with tras/per (A, 39%; B, 68%). R0-resection rate (A, 90%; B, 93%) and surgical morbidity (A: 43%; B, 44%) were comparable. Moreover, in-house mortality was equal in both arms (overall 2.5%). Median DFS was 26 months in arm A and not yet reached in arm B (HR 0.58, p = 0.14). After a median follow-up of 22 months median OS was not yet reached. DFS and OS rates [with 95% CI] at 24 months were 54% [38-71%] and 77% [63-90%] in arm A and 70% [55-85%] and 84% [72-96%] in arm B, respectively. More \u2265 grade 3 adverse events were reported with tras/per (75% vs. 85%), especially diarrhea (5% vs. 41%) and leukopenia (13% vs 23%). Conclusions The addition of tras/per to perioperative FLOT significantly improved pCR and nodal negativity rates in pts with Her2+ resectable EGA at the price of higher rates of diarrhea and leukopenia.

T-DXd is approved for the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer in the US and Japan. T-DXd increased confirmed ORR (42.9% vs 12.5%) and OS (median, 12.5 vs 8.4 mo; HR, 0.59;  P  = .0097) vs chemotherapy in patients (pts) with HER2+ (IHC 3+; IHC 2+/ISH +) metastatic gastric or GEJ cancer in the primary cohort in the DESTINY-Gastric01 open-label, multicenter, phase II trial (NCT03329690). We present results from the HER2-low exploratory cohorts. Methods Pts with centrally confirmed HER2-low (IHC 2+/ISH\u2212 [cohort 1] or IHC 1+ [cohort 2] on archival tissue) that progressed on \u2265 2 prior lines of therapy were enrolled in Japan and Korea. Pts were excluded if they had prior HER2 therapy. The primary endpoint was ORR by independent central review. Results 20 (cohort 1) and 24 (cohort 2) pts were treated with T-DXd 6.4 mg/kg q3w. Most were from Japan (cohort 1, 80.0%; cohort 2, 79.2%) and had received a median of 2 prior lines of therapy. At data cutoff (8 Nov 2019), no pts in cohort 1 and 2 in cohort 2 (8.3%) remained on treatment (median duration, 4.2 and 2.8 mo). In cohort 1, confirmed ORR was 26.3% (5/19, all PR); 12 pts had stable disease (DCR, 89.5%). Median PFS was 4.4 mo (95% CI, 2.7-7.1 mo); median OS was 7.8 mo (95% CI, 4.7 mo-NE), with a 12-mo OS rate of 40.0%. Confirmed ORR in cohort 2 was 9.5% (2/21, all PR); confirmed DCR was 71.4%. Median PFS and OS were 2.8 mo (95% CI, 1.5-4.3 mo) and 8.5 mo (95% CI, 4.3-10.9 mo), with a 12-mo OS rate of 25.7%. Grade \u2265 3 adverse events occurred in 70.0% and 79.2% of pts in cohorts 1 and 2. Decreased appetite (65.0%; 75.0%), nausea (55.0%; 79.2%), and neutrophil count decreased (45.0%; 50.0%) were most common. One pt in each cohort (grade 1 = 1; grade 2 = 1) had T-DXd\u2013related interstitial lung disease. Conclusions T-DXd showed preliminary evidence of clinical activity in pts with previously treated, HER2-low gastric or GEJ cancer. The safety profile was similar to that in the HER2+ primary cohort.

The incidence of all-grade diarrhoea was higher in the P + H + CT arm (62.6%  v  35.8% in the PLA + H + CT arm); the majority of events were grade 1 or 2 in severity.                                                                                               Conclusions The end-of-study analysis from JACOB confirmed evidence of treatment activity, with a 15% reduction in risk of death when adding P to H + CT in previously untreated pts with mGC/GEJC. The overall safety profile of P + H + CT was considered acceptable. Clinical trial identification NCT01774786.

FLOT has become SOC for resectable, esophagogastric adenocarcinoma (EGA). However, patient\u2019s outcome is still poor. This trial evaluates the addition of the VEGF-R2 inhibitor ramucirumab (RAM) to FLOT. Methods This is a prospective, international, randomized, investigator-initiated phase II/III trial. Patients (pts) with resectable, Her2-negative EGA(\u2265 cT2 or cN+) were randomized to 4 pre-and post-operative cycles of FLOT (docetaxel 50 mg/m 2 ; oxaliplatin 85 mg/m 2 ; leucovorin 200 mg/m 2 ; 5-FU 2600 mg/m 2 , q2w) alone (Arm A) or FLOT with RAM 8mg/kg q2w, followed by 16 cycles RAM (Arm B, FLOT-RAM). Here, we report the main results along with the subgroup analysis explaining the higher rate of R0-resection in the FLOT-RAM arm. Results In total, 180 pts (FLOT, 91; FLOT-RAM, 89) were randomized. Baseline characteristics were similar between arms (male, 73%; median age, 60y; cT3/T4, 83%; cN+, 78%; GEJ, 54%). The rate of signet-ring cell cancer was high (40%). As reported at ASCO, no difference in path response rates was seen (FLOT, 30%; FLOT-RAM, 27%). However, FLOT-RAM significantly improved R0-resection rate (FLOT, 82%; FLOT-RAM, 96%, p=0.0078). This difference was due to less pts in the FLOT-RAM arm with disease progression prior to operation (FLOT, 6%; FLOT-RAM, 1%), more pts proceeding to operation (FLOT, 93%; FLOT-RAM, 97%), more pts receiving resectional surgery (FLOT, 88%; FLOT-RAM, 97%), and less pts having residual tumor out of the resected pts (FLOT, 4; FLOT-RAM, 1). In the subgroup analysis, the relative benefit of FLOT-RAM in terms of R0-resection was seen in all groups but was a bit pronounced in the cT3/T4 group (FLOT, 80%; FLOT-RAM, 97%), specifically the T4 (FLOT, 1/4 [25%]; FLOT-RAM, 8/8 [100%]) and the diffuse/mixed type histology (FLOT, 77%; FLOT-RAM, 95%). Conclusions FLOT-RAM significantly improved R0-resection rates in a patient group enriched with diffuse type and signet cell histology, mainly because more pts proceeded to operation, more pts received resectional surgery, and less pts had residual disease. The effects were pronounced in more advanced stage and the diffuse/mixed type histology. Clinical trial identification NCT02661971; EudraCT: 2015-003118-26.

A prospective multicenter feasibility study,  EPOC study , has shown that an elemental diet (ED) may prevent OM determined by special diagnostic tools. In that study, we established a  central review system  ( CRS ) to assess the oral environment. OM grades were rated by a dental oncology specialist blinded to background data. Further evaluation as phase III randomized controlled trial (RCT) was needed. Methods We conducted a phase III multicenter RCT to elucidate the preventive effect of ED against OM in patients with esophageal cancer (EC) receiving DCF (docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil) therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive two cycles of DCF with (group A) or without (group B) ED (160 g/day) at a 1:1 ratio. The primary endpoint was the incidence of grade \u2265 2 OM assessed using  CRS  by two judges. Secondary endpoints were changes in body weight, prealbumin, c-reactive protein (CRP), rate of grade \u2265 2 OM, and DCF completion rate based on ED compliance. Results 117 patients were enrolled and randomized; 4 failed to start treatment and were excluded from primary analysis; 55 and 58 patients were allocated to groups A and B, respectively. There was no significant difference in patients\u2019 background. Grade \u2265 2 OM was demonstrated by 8 (14.5%) and 20 (34.5%) patients in groups A and B, respectively ( p  = 0.0141). At day 57, changes in body weight and prealbumin (%) were significantly higher in group A than group B ( p  = 0.0139 and 0.0181, respectively). During chemotherapy, changes in CRP (%) were lower in group A than group B, especially at day 36 ( p  =0.0394); patients with 100% ED compliance presented 13.3% of grade \u2265 2 OM, increased to 20% in those failing 100% compliance ( p  = 0.6273). DCF completion rate was 100% in patients with 100% ED compliance and 70% in patients failing ED completion ( p  = 0.0046). Conclusions Our multi-institutional RCT shows that ED has a preventive effect on OM in patients with EC receiving chemotherapy. Clinical trial identification jRCT s071180029.

MK-6482, a potent, selective, small molecule HIF-2\u03b1 inhibitor, was evaluated for efficacy for treatment of VHL-associated tumors in this open-label phase II study (NCT03401788). Methods Eligible patients (pts) were aged \u226518 yrs and had a VHL diagnosis based on germline  VHL  alteration, \u22651 measurable solid RCC tumor, no prior systemic anticancer therapy, and ECOG PS 0 or 1. Pts received MK-6482 120 mg orally once daily until progression, intolerable toxicity, or investigator/pt decision to withdraw. Primary end point: ORR of VHL-associated ccRCC tumors per RECIST v1.1 by independent review committee (IRC). Secondary end points: ORR in non-RCC tumors, DOR, and safety. Results As of June 1, 2020, 56 of 61 (92%) enrolled pts remain on treatment with a minimum of 60 wks follow-up. All pts had ccRCC, 100% had pancreatic lesions, 70% had CNS hemangioblastomas, and 26% had retinal lesions evaluable by IRC. For ccRCC, ORR was 36% (95% CI, 24-49%) and an additional 7 (11%) unconfirmed responses (documented at single time point and pending confirmation at data cutoff) were reported by IRC; all responses were PRs. DOR in confirmed responses was not reached (NR; range, 12-62 wks). The PFS rate at 52 wks was 98% (95% CI, 89-100%). For non-RCC tumors, per IRC, the ORR was 64% (4 CRs) in pancreatic lesions and 30% (5 CRs) in CNS hemangioblastomas; median DOR was NR (range, 11-71 wks) in pts with pancreatic lesions and NR (range, 12-72 wks) in pts with central nervous system hemangioblastomas. Of 16 pts with evaluable retinal lesions at baseline, 11 (69%) showed improvement per IRC. Treatment-related AEs were reported by 98% of pts; 13% had grade 3 TRAEs. There were no grade 4-5 TRAEs. Five pts discontinued treatment (patient decision [n=3], treatment-related adverse event [n=1; grade 1 dizziness], and death [n=1; acute fentanyl toxicity]). Conclusions MK-6482 continued to demonstrate promising antitumor activity against VHL-associated RCC and non-RCC tumors and was well tolerated. Clinical trial identification NCT03401788.

However, the association of physical spatial location and genetically driven tumour subclones was unclear. Methods 100 macroscopic tumour images taken at time of surgery were reviewed by a renal pathologist, and following quality control filtering accurate spatial data was available for 79 tumours. From these 79 cases, matched high-depth driver gene panel sequencing data was utilised from 756 individual biopsy regions (mean 9.6 biopsies per tumour). The boundaries between tumour and normal tissues were marked based on macroscopic photos by a renal pathologist, after which the positions of boundaries and biopsy regions were digitally extracted to X- and Y-coordinates. Spatial distances were calculated, with the correlations between spatial characteristics and genomic alterations investigated. Results We mapped the spatial location of 756 biopsies, across 79 ccRCCs, and integrated these coordinates with sequencing data. This enabled a resolution as to how genetically distinct subclones grow and evolve spatially. Compared with tumour margins, the level of somatic copy number changes was higher in tumour interiors. Moreover, metastasising clones were found to be more enriched in tumour interiors. The tumour subclones growing to largest physical size were characterised by gains of chromosomes 7q, 1q and and losses of chromosome 14q. The degree of discrepancy of genomic alterations across biopsy regions was positively correlated with spatial distances across biopsy regions. Tumour subclone growth was found to be predominantly spatially contiguous, with subclone dispersal a rare event found only in one case, which notably was associated with metastasis. Conclusions Spatial dynamics is strongly associated with genomic alterations and plays an important role in tumour evolution. Clinical trial identification NCT03226886.

Based on retrospective data (Szabados B. Eur Urol. 2018) that IO before CT was superior than the reverse sequence, we tested the hypothesis that induction avelumab followed by its combination with CG, followed by avelumab maintenance may enhance clinical benefit in patients unfit for cisplatin. Methods CT-na\u00efve ,  unresectable/mUC patients ineligible for cisplatin, as defined by Galsky criteria, were randomized to arm A: 2 cy of induction avelumab 10mg/kg Q2W followed by 6 cy of CG + avelumab (C 5AUC day 1, G 1000mg/m 2  day 1 and 8 and avelumab 10mg/kg day 15) Q3W, followed by avelumab 10mg/kg Q2W (n=42) until progressive disease or intolerance, compared with arm B: CG alone for 6 cy (n=43). The primary endpoint was ORR. Secondary endpoints were PFS, OS, duration of response (DoR) and safety. Results Baseline characteristics were generally balanced: median age 74 years, visceral metastasis (65%), renal impairment (60%) and ECOG-PS 2 (35%). The ORR was 57% (24/42) in arm A and 53% (23/43) in arm B (p= 0.73). 13 p (31%) in arm A progressed or died before the 1 st  response assessment (including 6 deaths in the 1 st  month) vs. 4 p (9.3%) in arm B. Median PFS was 6.9 m (95% CI, 2.2 to 8.4) in arm A vs. 7.4 m (95% CI, 5.8 to 9.7) in arm B (p=0.712). Median OS was 10.5 m (95% CI, 6.9 to NR) with avelumab/CG and 13.2 m (95% CI, 12.5 to 18.4) with CG (p=0.264). The 15-months OS rate was 45% (95% CI, 29 to 60) with avelumab/CG  vs . 39% with CG (95% CI, 22 to 56). Treatment-related adverse event of \u2265 Grade 3 occurred in 71% of patients in arm A and in 65% in arm B. Conclusions The previous hypothesis that IO before CT might optimize subsequent CT response was not proven. Early progression was higher in the induction avelumab arm (31%  vs . 9.3%). However, despite the follow-up being immature, superior percentual OS benefit was observed in the avelumab/CT arm followed by avelumab maintenance. Induction IO alone before CT/IO is not an adequate strategy. Ongoing phase III trials are looking at different sequencing/combination approaches.

We report prespecified subgroup analyses. Methods Pts were randomized 1:1 to avelumab + BSC or BSC alone, stratified by best response to 1L CTx (complete/partial response [CR/PR] vs stable disease [SD]) and by visceral vs nonvisceral disease. The primary endpoint was OS (from randomization). PD-L1 status was assessed using the Ventana SP263 assay. Results 700 pts were randomized to either avelumab + BSC (n=350) or BSC alone (n=350); median follow-up was >19 mo. An OS benefit with avelumab + BSC vs BSC alone (median [95% CI], mo) was observed across prespecified subgroups, including pts with objective response (CR/PR; 23.8 [19.0, not estimable (NE)] vs 15.0 [13.0, 18.7]; HR 0.69 [0.53, 0.89]) or SD (19.9 [18.2, NE] vs 14.0 [10.7, 19.4]; HR 0.70 [0.46, 1.05]) as best response to 1L CTx; and pts with visceral (18.9 [16.5, 21.4] vs 14.0 [11.7, 17.4]; HR 0.82 [0.62, 1.09]) and nonvisceral metastases (28.3 [23.8, NE] vs 15.2 [13.4, 20.2]; HR 0.54 [0.38, 0.76]). OS in other subgroups is shown (Table). No significant treatment-by-subgroup interaction (at 0.05 level) was observed for any subgroup variable. Additional subgroups, progression-free survival, objective response endpoints, and safety data will also be presented. Conclusions Avelumab 1L maintenance + BSC provided OS benefit vs BSC alone across prespecified subgroups of pts whose disease had not progressed with 1L induction CTx and is an important advance for 1L treatment of advanced UC.

Sitra has demonstrated antitumor activity as well as the reduction of Type 2 tumor-associated macrophages, regulatory T-cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells and enhancement of T cell-mediated anti-tumor immune response in nonclinical studies and patients. Given these pleiotropic immune-enhancing effects, we hypothesized that the combination of sitra with a CPI will augment clinical activity of CPI alone in UC. Methods This is a multi-cohort phase 2 Study (516-003) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the nivo+sitra combination in UC. This Cohort (C5) enrolled CPI-na\u00efve pts who have disease progression on or after prior platinum-based chemotherapy. Sitra is administered orally, daily; nivo intravenously, 240mg every 2 weeks or 480mg every 4 weeks. Based on the Predictively Probability Design, a target sample size of 26 pts in Stage 1 allows advancement to Stage 2 if clinically active. Other objectives include pharmacokinetics (PK) and correlative biomarkers. Results C5 met its prespecified clinical activity with 8 confirmed responses in the first 26 evaluable pts, and advanced to Stage 2 (ongoing). As of May 8, 2020, C5 has enrolled 36 pts with 26 having had \u22651 on-study tumor assessment. Preliminary confirmed investigator-assessed ORR per RECIST 1.1 was 31% (4% CR). Disease control rate (CR/PR/SD) was 77%. With median follow-up of 6.1 months, median PFS was 3.9 months (95% CI 1.9, 7.3). Most common (\u226520%) treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) included fatigue (49%), diarrhea (43%), decreased appetite (41%), dysphonia (30%), increased ALT (30%), hypertension (24%), nausea (22%) and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (22%). Grade 3/4 TRAEs occurred in 46% of pts. There were no Grade 5 TRAEs. Updated safety, PK and efficacy data will be presented. Conclusions Sitra with nivo combination is clinically active with manageable side effects in CPI-na\u00efve, platinum-experienced pts with UC. Clinical trial identification NCT03606174.

We aimed to analyze the benefit from perioperative radiotherapy (RT) according to HPV infection status. Methods Within an international, multicenter database of 1,254 patients (pts) with PSCC who received inguinal lymph node dissection (ILND) from Europe, United States, Brazil, United Kingdom and China, 507 had suitable clinical information. Kaplan-Meier and restricted mean survival time (RMST) examined the overall survival (OS) differences among HPV+ and HPV- patients according to the use of perioperative RT to involved regional lymph nodes. The analyses were also made after propensity score-matching (PSM; N=136). Multivariable Cox regression analyses for OS were also done. Finally, we looked at the genomic alterations landscape of PSCC from the Foundation Medicine database (N=199) to characterize HPV+ PSCC. Results Pts with HPV+ PSCC exhibited a lower clinical N-stage (p<0.001) and ILNM density (p<0.001). HPV+ patients had similar median OS (p=0.1) but longer RMST than HPV- patients at different time-points. Nevertheless, HPV+ patients treated with perioperative RT exhibited longer median OS (p=0.015) and longer RMST compared to HPV- pts. These findings were not confirmed with perioperative chemotherapy (p=0.19). In the PSM cohorts, HPV+ status remained significantly associated with longer OS after RT. In multivariable Cox regression analyses, pts with HPV+ PSCC exhibited a significantly improved OS compared with those with HPV- PSCC (HR: 0.12, 95%CI: 0.03-0.48; p=0.003). Among the several different genomic alterations frequencies, the top-altered genes (>20%) in HPV+ cases were  PI3KCA  (38.7%) and  KMT2D (25.8%), whereas in HPV- cases these were  TP53  (75.2%),  CDKN2A  (65%) and  TERT  (promoter region, 60.2%). Conclusions Perioperative RT was more effective in the subgroup of HPV+ PSCC. Reasons for enhanced RTsensitivity may also be related to the different landscape of genomic alterations. These results should be considered as hypothesis-generating and may inspire future prospective trials. Legal entity responsible for the study The authors. Funding Has not received any funding.

There is limited real-world data on how these patients are managed in clinical practice and their outcomes. To our knowledge this is the largest review of such patients to date. Methods A prospective database of over 1200 patients referred to the supra-regional penile multi-disciplinary team (MDT) at St George\u2019s Hospital London was collected from 2006 to 2020. Patients were treated at St George\u2019s Hospital or at other centres with oncology guidance from the St George\u2019s MDT. Metastatic disease was defined as the presence of disease outside the pelvis or those in whom curative therapy for the metastasis was not possible and hence treated with palliative intent. Indication of treatment was to treat symptoms and prolong survival. Clinical benefit rate (CBR), median progression free survival (mPFS) and median overall survival (mOS) were analyzed retrospectively. Results 101 patients (median age 63, IQR (56-72), 73% ECOG 0/1) were included. 32% (32/101) received adjuvant chemotherapy prior to metastatic recurrence of disease. 59% (59/101) patients received chemotherapy and 42% (42/101) received best supportive care (BSC). 17% (17/101) patients received subsequent second-line systemic therapy and 3% (3/101) patients received third-line systemic therapy.                    For first-line systemic-therapy (n=59), there was a 46% (27/59) CBR with 9% (5/59) complete response, 15% (9/59) partial response and 22% (13/59) stable disease. Patients receiving 2nd line subsequent- therapy (n=17) had a 29% (5/17) CBR. mPFS for first- and second-line treatment was 3.2 (95% CI: 2.0-4.5) and 2.2 (95% CI: 1.9-2.4) months respectively. mOS for all patients was 6.2 months (95% CI: 5.1-7.2). mOS for first-line chemotherapy, second-line chemotherapy and BSC patients was 7.2 (95% CI: 5.9-8.5), 4.5 (95% CI: 2.5-6.5) and 2.0 (95% CI: 1.1-2.9) months respectively. Conclusions First-line platinum-based chemotherapy is associated with notable response rates in mSCC patients. Subsequent therapy can be beneficial but outcomes remain sub-optimal. Agents with better response rates are needed urgently potentially in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy. Legal entity responsible for the study The authors.

However, data regarding treatment details are lacking in previous publications. The aim of this study was to investigate the risk of a second TC in relation to previous TC treatment, in particular the number of cisplatin-based CT cycles. Methods A population-based cohort of 5622 men diagnosed with first TC 1980-2009, as well as second TC, was identified by the Cancer Registry of Norway. Treatment data were based on medical records. Cumulative incidence of metachronous contralateral TC was estimated, and standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated to compare the risk to the general population. The effect of treatment intensity on the second TC risk was investigated using Cox regression. Results Median follow-up was 16.3 years, during which 206 men were diagnosed with a second TC after median 5.9 years. Median time to second TC was shorter after CT (5.5 years) than after surgery only (6.6 years). Overall, the 20-year crude cumulative incidence was 4.0% (95% CI 3.5-4.6), with lower incidence after CT (3.1 %, 95% CI 2.4-3.9) than after surgery only (5.7%, 95% CI 4.4-7.3). The second TC incidence was also lower for those >=30 years (2.8%, 95% CI 2.2-3.4) at first TC diagnosis than those <30 years (6.0 %, 95% CI 4.9-7.1). Overall, the risk of a second TC was 13-fold higher compared with the risk of developing TC in the general population (SIR 13.3, 95% CI 11.6-15.3). The SIR was lower after CT (9.1, 95% CI 7.1-11.6) than after surgery only (17.1, 95% CI 13.6-21.7). With surgery only as reference, treatment with CT significantly reduced the risk of a second TC (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.37-0.73). For each cisplatin-based CT cycle administered, the risk for a second TC decreased monotonously, with significantly reduced risks after 3, 4 and >4 cycles (HRs 0.45, 0.41, and 0.21 respectively). Conclusions The overall 20-year cumulative incidence of a second TC was 4.0%. Age at first TC diagnosis as well as treatment intensity influenced the risk of a second TC, with a monotonic risk reduction for each additional cisplatin-based CT cycle administered.

Methods Eligible pts had cT3-T4 M0 rectal cancers, <76 years, and WHO PS \u22641. Primary endpoint was 3-yr DFS. Secondary endpoints were ypT0N0 rate, OS, metastasis-free survival (MFS) and QoL assessed with EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-CR29. 460 pts were needed to observe 136 events to increase 3-year DFS from 75% to 85% (HR=0.56). Arm A pts received preop CRT (50 Gy, 2 Gy/fr + capecitabine), surgery, then adjuvant CT for 6 mos. Arm B pts received 6 cycles of mFOLFIRINOX, followed by the same preop CRT, surgery and 3 mos of adjuvant CT. Adjuvant CT consisted of mFOLFOX6 or capecitabine. Results (ITT) From 2012 to 2017, 230/231 pts were randomly assigned in Arm A/B. Median follow-up was 46.5 mos and 136 DFS events occurred. Main results are reported in the table below. Time to QoL deterioration \u2265 10 points was significantly longer in Arm A for chemotherapy symptoms (hair loss, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, appetite loss, diarrhea, dry mouth, taste) and worry about weight, and was significantly longer in Arm B for functional outcomes as dysuria (HR 0.61, p<0.01), buttock pain (HR 0.7, p=0.01), fecal incontinence (HR 0.73, p=0.05), sore skin (HR 0.67, p<0.01), bowel embarrassment (HR 0.73, p=0.05) and impotence in men (HR 0.64, p<0.01).

There is a need for optimising patient selection and radiotherapy to cure more patients with this modality. The aim of the study was to test high-dose radiotherapy of low rectal cancer for organ preservation in a multi-centre setting. The early endpoint of clinical complete response (cCR) at 12 weeks is reported here. Methods This prospective trial enrolled patients with rectal cancer 0-6 cm from the anal verge, T1-3 N0-1 M0, performance status 0-2, and adequate organ function. Radiotherapy consisted of 62 and 50.4 Gy to the tumour and regional lymph nodes, respectively, in 28 fractions using intensity-modulated radiation therapy and daily image guidance. Capecitabine 825mg/m 2  BID was administered on treatment days. Patients with cCR 6-12 weeks from end of treatment judged by MRI, endoscopy, and digital rectal exam were referred to observation without surgery. The patients continue follow-up for recurrence, adverse events, and patient reported outcomes irrespective of treatment. Results Three Danish centres enrolled 108 patients from 9/2015 to 12/2019; with 15%/54%/31% T1/T2/T3 tumours; median tumour distance from anal verge 4.5 cm; 29% with N1 disease; 36% female; median age 71 years. 107 patients started treatment, the majority receiving full dose of radiotherapy (n=104) and of chemotherapy (n=80). The most frequent grade 3-4 toxicities were diarrhoea (7%), constipation (2%), and nausea, vomiting, pain, and skin reaction (all 1%). One patient died from other causes and one left the study before evaluation. 12 weeks after end of treatment, 13 patients had residual tumour and were referred for surgery; two had distant metastasis leaving 90 of 108 patients (83.3%) with cCR and allocation to follow-up without surgery. Conclusions The unprecedented high cCR rate of 83.3% in this multicentre phase II trial demonstrates that rectal cancer patients can be offered curative chemoradiation. Long-term outcomes, including tumour control, organ function, and quality of life, are still needed to evaluate the full potential of high-dose 62 Gy radiotherapy as a new standard treatment.

However, in patients treated with CAPOX (especially low-risk patients), 3-m therapy had similar efficacy as the 6-m one. Herein, we report the overall survival (OS) and long-term DFS for the ACHIEVE trial, as part of the IDEA collaboration. Methods ACHIEVE was a randomized, open-label, multicenter study that allocated stage III CC patients to 3-m or 6-m mFOLFOX6/CAPOX post-surgery. Hazard ratios (HRs) for the association between survival endpoints and treatment duration (3 m or 6 m) were analyzed using the Cox model. Pre-planned confirmatory sub-group analyses included regimens and risk groups. Results As of September 2019, 175 deaths and 323 DFS events were observed in the modified intention-to-treat population (n=1,291), with an overall median survival follow-up of 62 m. Seventy-five percent of the patients received CAPOX. Fifty-six percent were low-risk (T1-3 and N1), while 44% were high-risk (T4 or N2). The 5-yr OS rate was 87% (95% confidence interval [CI], 84\u201390%) and 87% (84\u201389%) in the 3-m and 6-m therapy groups, respectively, with an estimated HR of 0.90 (0.67\u20131.21). The 5-year DFS rate was 75% (72\u201378%) and 74% (71\u201378%) in the 3- and 6-m therapy groups, respectively, with an estimated HR of 0.94 (0.76\u20131.18).

Three-month adjuvant CAPOX therapy could be used for most stage III CC patients, but our results should be interpreted in the context of the whole IDEA collaboration.

Case series and phase I and II prospective studies have documented respectively promising activity of the anti-EGFR cetuximab (CET) and of immunotherapy in chemorefractory advSCAC. In this study, we aimed to evaluate activity and safety of avelumab (AVE) alone or in combination with CET in pretreated advSCAC. Methods This was an open-label, \u201cpick the winner\u201d, prospective, multicenter randomized phase 2 trial (NCT03944252). Patients (pts) with mSCAC who had progressed after at least one line of treatment were randomized 1:1 to receive either AVE (arm A) or AVE+CET (arm B). A Simon\u2019s two-stage Mini-Max design was used. Primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR). The null hypothesis that the true response rate was 5% ( P  = 0,05) was tested against the alternative of a true response rate of 20% ( P 1= 0,20) in each arm. Type I error rate was set at 0,05. Secondary endpoints were progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and safety. No formal comparison was allowed between the two arms. Results 60 pts were enrolled, 30 in each arm. Median age was 63 years; M/F distribution was 19/41. All baseline characteristics were well balanced between the two arms. At a median follow up of 11 months, 5 patients out of 30 showed PR in arm B, reaching the primary endpoint. ORR was 10% (95% CI 2.5 - 27) and 17% (95% CI 6.3 \u2013 34,1) in arm A and B, respectively; Disease control rate (DCR) was 50% (95% CI 35.3 \u2013 71.3) in arm A and 57% (95% CI 42.4 \u2013 77.6) in arm B. Median PFS was 2.05 months (95% CI 1.84 \u2013 5.52) in arm A and 3.88 months (95% CI 2.07 \u2013 6.14) in arm B. Median OS data were not yet mature. The most common treatment related adverse event (TRAE) were fatigue in Arm A (17%) and skin and subcutaneous disorders in arm B (87%); 2 patients (7%) in arm B permanently interrupted the treatment due to TRAE; no permanent interruptions due to TRAE were observed in arm A. Conclusions The CARACAS Study met its primary endpoint in patients receiving AVE+CET (arm B), with promising activity of dual EGFR and PD-L1 blockade in advSCAC deserving further investigation. A favourable safety profile was observed in both of the study arms. Clinical trial identification NCT03944252. Legal entity responsible for the study Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV \u2013 IRCCS.

VEGF signaling has been linked with immune evasion and suppression within the tumor microenvironment as a possible resistance mechanism to immunotherapy. The combination of the anti-PD-L1 antibody atezolizumab (A) and anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab (B) demonstrated survival benefit in virally linked hepatocellular carcinoma. Here we evaluated the combination of A and B for pts with unresectable HPV-associated cancers. Methods Pts with previously treated, immunotherapy-na\u00efve HPV-associated cancers were eligible for this single-arm phase II study. Pts received A (1200 mg) and B (15 mg/kg) intravenously every 3 weeks until development of progressive disease or drug intolerance. Responses were evaluated every 9 weeks by RECIST Criteria v1.1. The primary objective was to measure best overall response rate (ORR). Pretreatment and on-treatment biopsies were collected for biomarker analyses. Results 20 pts with unresectable squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal were treated with A+B (median number of doses, 6). Median age was 59 years (range, 43-80). 60% of pts had received only 1 prior line of therapy. Partial responses, both verified, were seen in 2 pts (ORR 10%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2-32), with stable disease in 11 (55%) pts. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.1 months (95% CI: 2.6-NA). 12-month PFS rate was 20% (95% CI: 8-52). Median overall survival (OS) was 11.6 months (95% CI, 9.5-20). Grade \u22653 adverse events (AE) were observed in 7 (35%) pts, with one grade 5 treatment-related AE (bowel perforation). The most common grade \u22653 AEs were hyponatremia (N=4), infection (N=2), and hypertension (N=2). Updated biomarker analyses will be presented. Conclusions A + B displays potential clinical benefit for pts with treatment-refractory metastatic anal cancer. Further investigation to immunotherapy combination trials is warranted to build upon outcomes with immune checkpoint monotherapies. Ongoing correlative studies may identify predictive biomarkers associated with benefit for this combination. Clinical trial identification NCT03074513.

DPD expression is regulated at post-transcriptional level by miR-27a.  MIR27A  rs895819A>G has been associated with significant increased grade (G) \u22653 FP-tox only in patients (pts) carrying a deleterious  DPYD  variant (*2A/D949V/*13/HapB3). French GPCO-UNICANCER and RNPGx groups initiated the FUSAFE IPD-MA to develop predictive models of FP-tox, allowing to test whether  MIR27A  rs895819 improves the predictive value of  DPYD  variants. Methods Eligibility criteria included unbiased recruitment of Caucasian pts without FP dose adjustment based on DPD status. Main endpoint was hematological or digestive G4-5 FP-tox at 12 weeks. A clinical logistic regression model including age, sex, body mass index, FP administration (bolus\u00b1continuous  vs  continuous/p.o.) and associated anticancer drug (AAD) was first developed. Combined  DPYD  variants *2A/D949V/*13 with or without HapB3 (at least one mutated allele) and  MIR27A  rs895819 (dominant coding) were further included in this model, along with  DPYD  x  MIR27A  interaction. Results Full clinical data,  MIR27A , and  DPYD  variants were assessable in 2724 pts (5 studies): 71% colorectal cancer, 41% metastatic, 95% FP-na\u00efve, 31% 5FU, 55% AAD.  MIR27A  rs895819G was carried by 53.4% of pts (9.7% homozygotes) and 1.5% of pts (N=41) carried at least one *2A/D949V/*13  DPYD  variant. G4-5 FP-tox was 4.0%. Adjusted Odds Ratio were 6.9 [95%CI 3.0-16.0] for  DPYD  combined variants *2A/D949V/*13, and 1.3 [95%CI 0.9-1.9] for  MIR27A  rs895819, with no  DPYD  x  MIR27A  statistical interaction (p=0.99). Results on  MIR27A  and its interaction with  DPYD  variants were similar when considering G3-4-5 tox at cycle 1, or HapB3. Conclusions This IPD-MA on  MIR27A  and  DPYD  variants, including the largest series of pts published so far, do not confirm the previously published relevance of  MIR27A  rs895819 for toxicity risk stratification in patients carrying  DPYD  risk variants. The ongoing FUSAFE-2 project including sequencing of  DPYD  and  MIR  genes may provide new insights in FP pharmacogenetics. Clinical trial identification CRD 42017058148.

However, a minority of patients who undergo complete metastasectomy attain cure. In particular, up to 75% of oligometastatic CRC patients develop recurrence post-resection. Existing data in the oligometastatic setting has shown that the efficacy of postoperative adjuvant treatment is limited and is largely extrapolated from earlier stages. Establishing prognosis after oligometastatic resection is difficult and thus a need exists for a better prognostic marker. Circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) has been shown to identify minimal residual disease (MRD) and the risk of recurrence in early-stage disease. In this study, we present the largest clinical experience of MRD testing in the oligometastatic setting. Methods Tumour tissue and serial plasma samples were collected from CRC patients undergoing resection of metastases with curative intent as part of the PREDATOR study. A personalized and tumour-informed multiplex PCR assay (Signatera\u2122 bespoke mPCR NGS assay) was used for the detection and quantification of ctDNA for post-resection MRD assessment. The study evaluated the prognostic value of ctDNA correlating MRD status with clinical outcomes. Results A total of 100 patients were analysed. Post-oligometastatic resection, adjuvant therapy was given to 38% of the patients at the discretion of the treating physician. Post-surgery, MRD-positivity was observed in 52% (52/100) of patients, of which 86.5% (45/52) eventually relapsed (HR: 4.6; 95%CI: 2.6-8.1;  P <0.001). MRD-positive status was also associated with an inferior overall survival (HR: 22.0; 95%CI: 3.0-166.0,  P =0.002). At the time of the analyses, in the MRD-negative arm, 98% of patients were alive compared to 57.7% in the MRD-positive arm. In the multivariate analysis, ctDNA status was the most significant prognostic factor associated with PFS (HR: 4.59, 95% CI: 2.51-8.4;  P <0.001). Conclusions This study validates personalized ctDNA-based MRD status as the most significant biomarker for prognosis in patients with oligometastatic CRC. This biomarker may offer the clinical utility of guiding adjuvant treatment decisions in the oligometastatic setting and of informing future trial design.

Tumor-only sequencing, without a deep prior knowledge of studied genes, may confounds germline with somatic variants. Consequently, up to 11% of patients cannot be tracked due to the absence of known somatic mutations. We aim at enhancing sensitivity by identifying novel somatic variants sequencing paired tumor DNA and WBCs to monitor CC patients. Methods 150 patients with localized CC were prospectively recruited from October 2015 to October 2017. A custom 29-gene panel based on the Qiaseq chemistry which includes Unique Molecular Identifier was designed. The panel contains recurrent mutated regions and genes in CC. DNA extracted from matched FFPE and WBCs samples was sequenced on NextSeq platform at 500X and 1500X. Data analysis was performed with an optimized in-house bioinformatics pipeline to reduce background noise in variant calling. Variant allele frequency (VAF) was limited to 5%. Variants were ranked attending to VAF. Known pathogenic variants were determined based on our knowledge somatic variant database. Statistical analysis included log-rank test, Fischer\u00b4s exact test and Kaplan-Meier curves. Results All patients presented at least one cancer somatic mutation (CSM) trackable by ctDNA analysis. Known pathogenic mutations were found in only 134 (89.3%). The mean number of CSM versus pathogenic mutations were 14 and 2, respectively. We identified 12 recurrently mutated genes which did not concur when we considered both known and unknown CSM. In patients harboring only one pathogenic variant (29.3%), 34% of times did not coincide with the somatic variant with the highest VAF. In those with 2 pathogenic variants (60%), just 12.2% coincided with the highest CSM. After a median follow-up of 35.8 months, 19 patients recurred. Conclusions In localized CC, when only known pathogenic mutations were studied, almost 11% of cases could not be tracked. In contrast, targeted sequencing of matched tumor and WBCs samples revealed novel cancer CMS and increased the sensitivity to universally track MRD in plasma.

Methods A phase I/II study of oral PLX8394 with or without an oral CYP3A4 inhibitor, cobicistat (150 mg daily) to enhance systemic exposure, enrolled patients (pts) with advanced solid tumours to establish recommended phase II dose (R2PD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLT). Dynamic changes in plasma ctDNA using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) were compared to treatment outcomes. Results 69 pts (BRAF V600 , 43; BRAF non-V600 , 17; non-BRAF, 9; colorectal cancer, 30%; melanoma, 14%) were treated with escalating doses of PLX8394 (450-1,800 mg BID) with or without cobicistat. Grade 3 (G3) AST elevation (900 mg BID) was the only DLT. Other  > G3 toxicities occuring in more than 1 pt included ALT (4), AST (2), bilirubin (3), and diarrhea (2). The RP2D was declared at 900 mg BID. Coadministration of cobicistat resulted in 2-3-fold increase in PLX8394 systemic exposure, with dose dependent increase. Partial responses (-32% to -100%) lasting up to 56 months were observed in 10 pts (BRAF V600 , 9; BRAF fusion, 1; prior BRAF and MEK inhibitors, 2) of 46 pts with BRAF alterations. Dynamic changes in BRAF V600 -mutant ctDNA in 11 pts with available serial samples for ddPCR testing demonstrated that the median variant allele frequency (VAF) was lower at baseline, on day 21 of cycle 1 and at the first restaging in pts without progression vs. those with progression (p=0.02, p=0.05, p=0.02, respectively). Pts with detectable ctDNA at any timepoint had a shorter median progression-free survival (p<0.04). Increase in ctDNA VAF preceded or co-occurred with progression in 6 pts (67%). Targeted NGS of serially collected ctDNA samples from 16 pts detected broad spectrum somatic alterations in 14 samples and clonal evolution corresponded with the clinical course. Conclusions PLX8394 and cobicistat demonstrated a favorable safety profile and encouraging activity in patients with advanced cancers with BRAF class I and II alterations. Dynamic changes in ctDNA were predictive of clinical outcomes. Clinical trial identification NCT02428712. Legal entity responsible for the study Plexxikon. Funding Plexxikon. Disclosure E.J.

Pamiparib, an investigational oral PARP1/2 inhibitor, has shown PARP-DNA complex trapping activity, brain penetration, and synergistic cytotoxicity with LD TMZ in nonclinical studies and preliminary antitumor activity in pts with solid tumors. Methods This ongoing phase Ib study consists of a dose-escalation (3+3 design) and dose-expansion phase. In dose escalation, pts received pamiparib 60 mg PO BID on Days 1-28 and LD TMZ at escalating doses PO QD on Days 1-7, 1-14, or 1-28 of each 28-day cycle. Dose-expansion pts, including pts with gastric cancer and SCLC with 1-2 prior lines of chemotherapy, were treated at the recommended phase II dose of pamiparib 60 mg PO BID on Days 1-28 and LD TMZ 60 mg PO QD on Days 1-7. Tumor assessments occurred every 8 weeks. Endpoints were safety/tolerability (CTCAE v4.03) and antitumor activity (RECIST v1.1). Biomarker assessments included determination of DDR mutational status (SNV/CNV homozygous loss) of 16 core DDR genes in circulating tumor DNA and genomic instability score (GIS) by the Myriad myChoice\u00ae HRD test. Herein, we present data from the biomarker analysis. Results As of 10 April 2020, 114 pts were enrolled (n=66, dose escalation; n=48, dose expansion). Median follow-up was 8.5 mo (range: 0.3, 26.5). Of 36 pts analyzed for GIS, 11 (31%) were GIS positive (GIS +  \u226533), with an ORR of 82% and disease control rate (DCR) of 91% across multiple tumor types. Antitumor activity was observed in  BRCA                       m /GIS +  (n=5; ORR and DCR, 100%) and  BRCA                       wt /GIS +  pts (n=6; ORR, 67%; DCR, 83%). Responses were observed in 3 GIS \u2013  pts with pancreatic cancer, pheochromocytoma, and nonsquamous NSCLC (ORR=12%; DCR, 52%). Of 104 pts analyzed for DDR mutational status, 27 (26%) were DDR + , with an ORR of 26% and DCR of 52%. In DDR \u2013  pts, ORR was 14% and DCR was 67%. Five pts were both GIS +  and DDR + . Conclusions In this limited subset of pts analyzed for GIS status, GIS +  pts derived superior benefit from pamiparib + LD TMZ, irrespective of  BRCA  status. GIS status appears to be the most robust biomarker to predict response to pamiparib + LD TMZ. Clinical trial identification NCT03150810.

We have developed the VIGex test, a gene expression panel using RNA data, developed from a pan-cancer cohort of 649 tumor samples and a set of 51 immune-related genes (including genes related to interferon-\u03b3 signalling, T-cell exhaustion, Tregs, tumor associated macrophages (TAM) and antiinflammatory cytokines) (submitted ESMO2020). Methods We conducted a retrospective review of the pts treated with IT at VHIO\u015b Phase 1 Unit from 2018-2019 who had VIGex performed prior to IT. 2 clusters (hot (HT) and cold (CT)) were defined by VIGex and correlated with clinical benefit rate (CBR) and progression free survival (PFS). A subset of CT enriched for TGFb signaling and TAMs associated genes was identified. CBR was defined as the sum of partial responses and stable disease (SD) for \u22654 months (m). The primary objective was to describe preliminary signs of predictive value from VIGex. Results Overall, 61 pts were identified, median age was 60 years, all ECOG \u22641, 30 treated with single IT agents (49%) and 31 with IT combinations (51%). Median prior lines were 2 (1-3) and median follow-up was 5.8 m. VIGex was performed on primary tumor (59%) or metastases (41%). In the whole cohort, CBR was 25% (5 pts (8%) achieved a partial response (PR) and 10 pts (17%) achieved a prolonged SD). Median PFS and OS were 1.7 m (CI95% 1.4 \u2013 2.3) and 6.7 m (CI95% 4.5 \u2013 9.5) respectively. VIGex algorithm classified 20 pts as HT and 41 pts as CT. CBR was 55% in the HT group and 18% for CT group (p= 0.016 Fisher\u015b exact test). Interestingly, CT subgroup enriched for TGFb signaling and TAMs had a 0% CBR. Significantly longer progression free survival (PFS) was also observed for HT vs. CT clusters (HR: 0.5; 0.28 \u2013 0.89; p = 0.02). Of note, significance was maintained after adjustment in a multivariate model for other prognostic variables (age, ECOG and single vs. combination IO treatments). Conclusions Our results suggest that VIGex may be a predictive marker of IT benefit in phase I clinical trials. With upcoming early phase IT treatments, VIGex could become a promising tool to enrich patient\u015b selection and improve clinical outcomes.

TQB2450 is an engineered anti-programmed death-ligand 1 antibody. This study aimed to assess the safety and effect of TQB2450 plus anlotinib in patients with advanced solid tumour. Methods This phase Ib study, which included a dose-escalating phase and an expansion phase, enrolled patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumour who had standard treatment failure or no standard treatment between June 2019 and January 2020. Eligible patients were firstly enrolled into sequential dose-escalating cohorts including 10mg and 12mg anlotinib plus TQB2450 following the conventional 3+3 design. If the starting dose of 10mg anlotinib led to \u22652 dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), 8mg anlotinib would be administered. After the dose-escalating phase completed, eligible patients were enrolled into the expansion cohort. The primary outcomes were safety and objective response rate (ORR). Results In the dose-escalating phase, the first 3 eligible patients received 10mg anlotinib plus TQB2450 had no DLTs in the first cycle, neither did the 3 patients who received 12mg anlotinib plus TQB2450. Then the expansion phase started, 16 patients were enrolled and received 12mg anlotinib plus TQB2450. Of the 22 patients included, there are 6 patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC), 8 patients with non-small cell lung cancer, 2 patients with colorectal cancer, 2 patients with breast cancer, 2 patients with ovarian cancer, 1 patient with thymic carcinoma and 1 patient with cervical cancer. Of Those patients, ORR was 32.8% and Disease control rate was 81.8%. Four SCLC patient had PR and 1 SCLC patient had stable disease. Ten \u22653 grade AEs were observed (Table).

BI 836880 is a humanized bispecific nanobody\u00ae that targets VEGF and Ang2, and BI 754091 is an anti-PD-1 antibody. Dose-finding trials of BI 836880 and BI 754091 in advanced solid tumours determined the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for monotherapy as 720 mg q3w and 240 mg q3w, respectively. Here, we report results from a phase Ib study assessing BI 836880 in combination with BI 754091. Methods In part 1 (dose escalation), pts with locally advanced or metastatic (m) non-squamous NSCLC who progressed during/after completion of \u22652 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy (CT) \u00b1 a checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) received BI 836880 plus fixed-dose BI 754091. RP2D was determined as BI 836880 720 mg plus BI 754091 240 mg q3w. In Part 2 (expansion phase), patients are recruited to one of 7 cohorts: mNSCLC after CPI monotherapy; mNSCLC after CT + CPI; mSCLC after CT \u00b1 CPI; immunotherapy-resistant m-melanoma; recurrent glioblastoma after 1st-line CT; HCC after prior sorafenib or lenvatinib; and previously untreated/unresectable HCC. Results At data cut-off (April 2020), 18 pts had received BI 836880 plus BI 754091 (14 in Part 1, 4 in Part 2); 11 males; median age 59 years, 13 had received prior CPI. Seven pts remain on treatment (including 1 treated for >12 months). 16 pts experienced an adverse event (AE; any-cause), most commonly (all%/G3%) hypertension (50/28), asthenia (33/6), vomiting, nausea and cough (each 33/0). No G4 AEs were reported; 2 G5 AEs occurred (1 general physical health deterioration and 1 tracheal haemorrhage). 6 pts had immune-related AEs (including G2 hypothyroidism; G2 pruritus, G2 vomiting, G1 papular rash). To date, 3 pts have achieved confirmed partial response (two NSCLC pts in Part 1, one 2 nd -line HCC pt in Part 2), 10 pts had stable disease, 3 had progressive disease; data were not available for 2 pts. Conclusions The combination of BI 836880 and BI 754091 had a manageable safety profile, and preliminary antitumor activity was observed. Expansion cohorts are ongoing.

ONO-4578 is a novel, potent, and highly selective small-molecule antagonist of EP4. Our preclinical data showed that ONO-4578 promoted anti-tumour immunity and a combination of ONO-4578 and anti-PD-1 antibody resulted in enhanced anti-tumour effects in syngeneic mouse models compared with anti-PD-1 monotherapy. ONO-4578 in combination with Nivolumab may be useful in the treatment of cancer patients (pts). Methods This is a first-in-human, dose-escalation study. We evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ONO-4578 monotherapy (Part A) and combination with Nivolumab (Part B) in pts with advanced or metastatic solid tumours. Patients received ONO-4578 (30-100 mg, QD, orally), or a combination of ONO-4578 (2-60 mg, QD, orally) and Nivolumab (240 mg, i.v., Q2W). We evaluated pharmacological effect on ex vivo TNF-\u03b1 release and urinary tetranor-PGEM. Results As of 6 Feb 2020, 10 pts received ONO-4578 monotherapy (1 pt at 30 mg, 3 pts at 60 mg, 6 pts at 100 mg), and 21 pts received a combination of ONO-4578 and Nivolumab (3 pts each at 2, 5, 10, 20, 40 mg and 6 pts at 60 mg of ONO-4578). DLTs occurred in 3 pts: grade (G) 3 duodenal ulcer at 100 mg in Part A; G3 erythema multiforme at 60 mg, G3 amylase increased and G4 lipase increased at 60 mg in Part B. MTD was not reached in either parts. Treatment was discontinued due to AEs for 2 pts in Part A (2 duodenal ulcers, duodenitis and gastritis) and 2 pts in Part B (erythema multiforme, amylase increased and lipase increased). ONO-4578 exposure was dose-proportional up to 100 mg and not interactive with nivolumab. Of 10 tumour-evaluable pts in Part A, no pts had complete or partial responses, and 3 pts had stable disease (SD). Of 21 tumour-evaluable pts in Part B, 1 pt (SCLC, ONO-4578 dose, 40 mg) had partial response (PR), and 5 pts had SD including 1 pt (PDAC, 2 mg) unconfirmed PR. Conclusions ONO-4578, both monotherapy and in combination with Nivolumab, was well tolerated. The MTD was not reached in patients with solid tumours.

BGB-A333 is an investigational humanized monoclonal antibody against PD-L1 that has antitumor activity in xenograft models. Tislelizumab, a clinical-stage anti-PD-1 antibody, showed clinical activity in patients (pts) with advanced solid tumors. We report results from the expansion cohort (phase IIB) of an open-label phase I/II study (NCT03379259) of BGB-A333 plus tislelizumab in pts with previously treated advanced urothelial carcinoma (UC). Methods Patients received BGB-A333 1350 mg IV Q3W + tislelizumab 200 mg IV Q3W. Eligible pts had locally advanced or metastatic UC without prior PD-(L)1 therapy, could not tolerate or progressed during/after treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy, and had an ECOG performance status of \u22641. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1. Key secondary endpoints included duration of response (DoR) per RECIST v1.1, progression-free survival (PFS) estimated with Kaplan-Meier analysis, and the safety/tolerability profile evaluated by monitoring adverse events (AEs). Results As of 10 March 2020, 12 pts (median age, 69.5 yr; 92% male) with UC were enrolled; median study follow-up, 8.3 mo. Most pts (n=10, 83%) had 1 prior systemic therapy. Median duration of treatment for both BGB-A333 and tislelizumab was 5.5 mo (range: 1.2, 9.9). Confirmed ORR was 42% (95% CI: 15.2, 72.3); 3 pts had complete responses, 2 had partial responses, 4 had stable disease (SD; 2 had SD >6 mo), 2 had progressive disease, and 1 was not evaluable (due to missing postbaseline assessment). Median DoR was not reached; median PFS was 6.1 mo (95% CI: 1.9, not estimable). Across the entire study (n=39), treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) occurred in 19 pts. Of the 24 pts receiving combination treatment, four pts (including one with UC) had grade \u22653 TRAEs. One pt with UC had an immune-related AE (myositis); no pts with UC had a fatal TRAE. Conclusions BGB-A333 in combination with tislelizumab was well tolerated and demonstrated antitumor activity in pts with advanced UC. Clinical trial identification NCT03379259.

Dubermatinib is a novel, orally administered small molecule AXL kinase inhibitor affecting mesenchymal-epithelial transition while targeting oncogenesis and chemoresistance. Methods Ph I enrolled 45 pts with advanced solid tumors across 9 dose levels (1.5-37mg/m 2 ) and 50mg flat dose. The RPh2D was determined as 50mg dubermatinib QD 21/28 days based on dose-proportionate drug accumulation including metabolites, and thrombocytopenia. Five expansion cohorts enrolled 1) dubermatinib plus IO with progression after response (n=19); 2) dubermatinib plus EGFR inhibitor in EGFR +  NSCLC with progression after response (n=18); 3) KRAS +  CRC (n=47); 4) platinum refractory/resistant ovarian cancer (n=22); 5) BRAF mut/wt  melanoma (n=13). Results In 125 patients receiving at least one 50mg dose the most frequently observed Gr3/4 AEs were anemia, diarrhea (7/5.6%); hyponatremia, dyspnea (5/4.0%); vomiting, ascites, fatigue, incr alkphos, decr potassium, PE (3/2.4%). PK values for plasma dubermatinib and active metabolites rose incrementally with dose (t\u00bd 12-20hrs). Day 1 C max  and AUC 0-24  (50mg) were 14.8 ng/mL and 160.9 ng*hr/mL, respectively. Increases were observed at Day 21. Clinical activity included 4 PRs: 2 NSCLC (1 pt 37mg/m 2  dubermatinib+TKI, 1 pt 50mg dubermatinib+nivolumab), 1 melanoma pt. 9mg/m 2  and 1 cholangiocarcinoma pt. 50mg, both single agent dubermatinib. Dose reduction rate at RP2D was <10% with overall CBR observed in 18.4% (23/125) of pts including 4 PRs and SD>4 months in heavily pretreated patients. PD evaluation of pre, post-treatment tumor biopsies and PBMCs correlated with drug activity (dose dependent sAXL reduction and GAS6 increase on treatment Day 8). Changes in immune cell infiltration, activity of antigen presenting cells and polarization of macrophages will be presented. Conclusions Dubermatinib at 50mg orally once daily was tolerated, with evidence of AXL engagement in surrogate tissues and preliminary evidence of clinical activity. Combination studies with TKIs and IO agents are being analyzed. Clinical trial identification NCT02729298 JAPIC ID: JapicCTI-194793.

JNJ64619178 is an oral, potent and selective PRMT5 inhibitor that demonstrates efficacy in multiple tumor models. Here, we present a phase I study of JNJ64619178 in adults with advanced solid tumors and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (Part 1). Methods Dose escalation was supported by a modified continual reassessment method. Patients (pts) received JNJ64619178 either intermittently (14 days on/7 days off) or once daily (QD) on a 21-day cycle. Safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy were evaluated to identify the recommended phase II doses (RP2D). Results Fifty-four pts were enrolled as of 17 Mar 2020. The most common tumor types were adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC; 20%), prostate cancer (15%), and uveal melanoma (13%). Median age was 59 (range 28-82), and median number of prior systemic therapies was 3 (range 0-11). Dosing ranged from 0.5\u2009mg to 4\u2009mg intermittently, and from 1\u2009mg to 2\u2009mg QD. Median treatment duration was 1.5 mo (range 0.4-22.4). The only dose-limiting toxicity observed was thrombocytopenia, at 3 and 4 mg intermittently and 2 mg QD. Fifty-one pts (91%) experienced treatment-related adverse events (TRAE), the most common being thrombocytopenia (52%), anemia (41%), nausea (39%), fatigue (32%), dysgeusia (30%), asthenia (24%), and diarrhea (20%). Grade 3/4 TRAEs in >1 pt were thrombocytopenia (20%), anemia (17%), and neutropenia (6%). Thirty pts (56%) had dose interruptions or reductions due to AE. JNJ64619178 plasma C max  and AUC were linearly dose-proportional. Robust target engagement, as measured by plasma SDMA, was achieved even with intermittent dosing. A confirmed partial response (RECIST) was observed in ACC, and 7 pts (13%) with ACC, prostate cancer, salivary gland carcinomas, and other tumor types had stable disease >6 mo. Two provisional RP2Ds were selected: 1.5 mg intermittently and 1 mg QD. Conclusions JNJ64619178 demonstrated manageable toxicity and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity at selected dose levels. Intermittent dosing maintains target inhibition. Assessment of two provisional RP2Ds is ongoing. Clinical trial identification NCT03573310.

Here we describe tumor molecular features and evidence of on target activity in SAR439859-treated pts. Methods Plasma circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and paired biopsies were collected at baseline (BL), on treatment (OT) and end of treatment (EOT: cfDNA only) from heavily pretreated postmenopausal pts with ER+/HER2- mBC who received SAR439859 monotherapy (Part A: dose range 20\u2013600 mg QD; Part B: 400 mg QD) in a phase I/II study (NCT03284957). In cfDNA at BL and EOT, mutation (mut) analysis was performed on a next generation sequencing panel of 77 genes.  ESR1  muts in cfDNA at BL and OT were assessed by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR). In tumor tissue, ER and progesterone receptor (PgR), Ki67 and Bcl-2 expression over time were assessed by immunohistochemistry; changes in ER signaling pathway activation were assessed by gene set variation analysis (RNA sequencing). Response was assessed in pts who received SAR439859 \u2265150 mg QD. Results At BL, in cfDNA from 63 pts, 95% had \u22651 mut, 52% had \u22651  ESR1  mut, 92% had \u22651 non- ESR1  mut and 49% had concurrent  ESR1  and other muts. Most prevalent BL non- ESR1  muts were in  PIK3CA  (44% of pts),  EGFR  (33%),  TP53  (30%) and  MET  (25%).  ESR1  muts most commonly detected at BL and EOT were D538G, Y537S and Y537N.  ESR1  muts tended to decrease OT; of 14 pts with  ESR1  muts at BL, 2 had WT  ESR1  OT. In 8 paired biopsies (7 were highly proliferative luminal B tumors), ER, PgR and Ki67 decreased (median relative change from BL: -58%, -88% and -33%), while Bcl-2 increased (24%). ER activation score decreased in 3/5 paired biopsies tested (median change from BL -0.38). SAR439859 showed clinical benefit (complete response + partial response [PR] + stable disease \u226524 weeks) in 40% (12/30) of WT  ESR1  pts and 32% (9/28) of mutated  ESR1  pts, per ddPCR. Of the 5 pts with PRs, 4 had WT  ESR1  and 1 had 2  ESR1  muts, at BL. Conclusions Common genomic alterations, including in  ESR1  and  PIK3CA , were detected in most mBC pts. SAR439859 showed clinical benefit irrespective of  ESR1  mut status and resulted in ER degradation and pathway inhibition in heavily pretreated pts. Clinical trial identification NCT03284957.

Lerociclib, dosed twice daily (BID) with no drug holiday in combination with fulvestrant, has a favorable safety profile with low rates of GI adverse events and Grade 3/4 neutropenia, as well as encouraging antitumor activity in pts with HR+/HER2- ABC (NCT02983071). Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) analysis in peripheral blood was conducted to characterize mechanisms of response and resistance in pts that received lerociclib and fulvestrant. Methods Pts with pretreated ABC were enrolled across doses of lerociclib 200\u2013650 mg once daily and 100\u2013250 mg BID in combination with fulvestrant 500 mg. Peripheral blood samples were drawn and cfDNA was isolated at baseline, cycle 1 day 15, each time point when tumor assessments were performed during the treatment period, and at the end of treatment. Samples were analyzed using the Guardant360 platform. Results Currently, 58 pts have been evaluated at baseline, with 44 pts (75.9%) harboring at least one somatic single nucleotide variant (mutation) in the genes evaluated. Seventeen pts (29.3%) harbored mutations in PIK3CA, with H1047R being the most common (8/17, 47.1%). Seven pts (12.1%) harbored mutations in ESR1, with D583G being the most common (4/7, 57.1%). No pts had mutations in both ESR1 and PIK3CA at baseline. Additionally, 3 pts (5.2%), 2 pts (3.4%), and 1 pt (1.7%) had mutations in genes at baseline associated with CDK4/6 resistance (RB1, CCND1, and CCNE1, respectively). Additional analyses of cfDNA (cycle 1 day 15 and end of treatment) along with correlation of cfDNA dynamics with clinical response are ongoing and will be presented. Conclusions The most common baseline mutations detected were PIK3CA and ESR1. Additional analyses, including cycle 1 day 15 change from baseline and correlation with clinical response, are anticipated to help elucidate predictors of response and/or resistance to the combination of lerociclib and fulvestrant in patients with HR+ ABC.

Real world data evaluate the final impact of care strategies. Methods ESME gathers full clinical data of all pts who initiated MBC trt in 18 French Cancer Centers between 01/2008-12/2016 (N=22109). Primary objective: prognostic effect of yr of diagnosis (YOD) on overall survival (OS) among pts with the 3 main subtypes: HR+/HER2- (n = 13656), HER2+ (n = 4017), triple-negative (TNBC) (n = 2963). We used multivariate adjusted Cox regression analyses including classical prognostic factors (R software). Results Median follow-up was 51.8 months (mo) (95%CI 51-52.7). YOD had no effect on the OS of TNBC pts. However, YOD >2013 appeared as an independent predictor of better OS in pts with HER2+ MBC, while it had an opposite effect in HR+/HER2- cases (Table). In the latter, median OS was 36.7 mo (95% CI: 35-38.7) YOD 2015 versus 44.5 mo (42.1-47.7) YOD 2008. Several sensitivity analyses showed similar trends. We will present explanatory analyses.

However, before routine use of Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/6 inhibitors, many patients (pts) were given CT as first therapeutic line (L1). We aimed to compare the progression free survival (PFS) under ET, depending on whether it was given before or after any CT. Methods All pts who initiated treatment for a newly diagnosed mBC between 2008 and 2014 in all 18 French Comprehensive Cancer Centers were included in the ESME ( Epidemiological Strategy and Medical Economics ) mBC database. ESME collects and centralizes retrospective real-world data. Primary endpoint of the present study was the evaluation of PFS under the first ET (PFS-ET1), depending on its position in relation to CT. PFS-ET1 was defined as time between the starting date of first ET and first disease progression or death. Secondary endpoint was PFS under the second ET (PFS-ET2). Results Out of 16702 pts in ESME mBC database, 6293 pts with HR+/HER2- mBC who received at least one ET as metastatic disease were included. Median age at mBC diagnosis was 62.0 years (95%CI 23-96). Median follow-up reached 44.7 months (mo). As L1, 3832 (60.9%) pts received ET without CT (ET first group (ET1G)), while 2461 (39.1%) received CT (CT first group (CT1G)), with 2024 (32.2%) receiving ET as maintenance treatment (ET-M) after CT. Pts in CT1G were younger (median age 57.0 vs. 66.0, p<0.001) and more likely to have visceral metastases (59.5% vs. 39.4%, p<0.001). Median PFS-ET1 was 12.4 mo in ET1G vs. 12.6 mo in CT1G (HR 0.96, [95% CI 0.90;1.01], log-rank p=0.13). 1668 pts received at least two ET: 1069 (64.1%) as second-line therapy (L2) after L1 ET (ET1G) and 599 (36.0%) (CT1G) after at least one CT, with 279 (16.7%) as ET-M after CT L2. Median PFS-ET2 was 5.8 mo for ET1G vs. 5.6 mo for CT1G (HR 1.07 [95% CI 0.96;1.19], log-rank p=0.20). Conclusions In this large series of HR+/HER2\u2013 mBC pts, there was no difference in PFS on ET if it was given before or after CT. This was true both for first- and second-line ET.

The present study describes the largest-to-date real-life cohort of MBC patients with this clinical picture. Methods We retrospectively analyzed data from the ESME MBC French database including pts who initiated care for MBC between 2008-2016. The primary objective was to report the characteristics, management, and outcomes of those with first isolated CNS metastases, excluding pts with intrathecal treatment (IT) for leptomeningeal disease. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier method. Descriptive statistics and multivariate Cox model were used. Results Of the 22,266 pts in the database, 541 (2.4%) had first isolated CNS metastases and no IT: median age was 57 years, median time to MBC, 22.8 months (mo). HER2+ cases were more frequent than the triple-negative (TN) or HR+/HER2- ones (41.6% vs. 26.1% vs. 28.5%, p<0.01). Treatment consisted of both local and systemic therapy (49.5%), only local (17.9%), only systemic (11.5%), or no treatment (18.5%). After a median follow-up of 43.3 mo, median first-line PFS and OS were 6.1 mo (95%CI: 5.7-6.8) and 20.7 mo (95%CI: 17.3-24.3). Older age, TN subtype, MBC-free interval (6-12 mo), lower PS and whole-brain radiotherapy were associated with worse survival by multivariate analysis. Median OS in the HR+/HER2+, HR+/HER2-, HR-/HER2+ and TN subgroups were 37.9 mo (95%CI: 25.9-47.6), 22.9 mo (95% CI: 17.1-31.9), 19.2 mo (95% CI: 14.3-28.9) and 11.5 mo (95%CI: 9.6-15.4), respectively. Compared with none, the use of systemic therapy within 3 months was associated with a better median OS by univariate analysis (24.1 vs. 16.1 mo (HR=0.8 [95%CI: 0.6-1.0], p=0.031), not confirmed by multivariate analysis (HR=1.0 [95%CI: 0.7-1.3], p=0.806). Conclusions MBC patients with first isolated CNS metastases, excluding leptomeningeal disease, represent a distinct population with specific management. In this context, the role of systemic therapy needs to be further investigated in prospective studies. Clinical trial identification NCT03275311. Legal entity responsible for the study UNICANCER.

However, an optimal partner with cisplatin remains to be exploited. As nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab)-paclitaxel gained a high response in the treatment of mTNBC, we conducted GAP trial to assess the efficacy and safety of nab-paclitaxel plus cisplatin (AP) versus GP as first-line therapy for patients with mTNBC. Methods In this phase III trial, we randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) patients with untreated metastatic triple-negative breast cancer to receive AP (nab-paclitaxel 125mg/m 2  on day 1, 8 and cisplatin 75 mg/m 2  on day 1) or GP (gemcitabine 1250 mg/m 2  on days 1, 8 and cisplatin 75 mg/m 2  on day 1) intravenously every 3 weeks until progression disease, intolerable toxicity or withdrawal of consent. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) and secondary end points included overall response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS) and safety. Results 127 patients received AP and 126 received GP from 9 centers (median follow-up, 17.8 months for AP group and 14.9 months for GP group). The median PFS was 9.9 months with AP, as compared with 7.5 months with GP (hazard ratio [HR], 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50-0.87; P=0.004). The ORR was significantly higher with AP (81.1%, vs. 56.3% with GP; P<0.001). A trend for improved OS in the AP group was observed (median, not reached; HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.51-1.11; P=0.16). Of the grade 3 or 4 adverse events, there was a significantly higher incidence of neuropathy (18.8% vs. 0%) in the AP group, and thrombocytopenia (3.9% vs. 29.4 %) in the GP group. Serious adverse events occurred in 3.9% patients (5/127) in the AP group and 2.4% patients (3/126) of patients in the GP group. Conclusions Nab-paclitaxel plus cisplatin improved PFS and ORR in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer as a first-line treatment, as compared with GP, while OS results are much awaited. Safety profiles of the two combinations were different but the adverse events were manageable. Clinical trial identification NCT02546934. Legal entity responsible for the study The authors.

Methods IPATunity130 Cohort B enrolled pts with HR+ HER2\u2013  PIK3CA / AKT1/PTEN -altered measurable aBC suitable for chemotherapy (CT). Pts with prior CT for aBC or relapse <1 y since (neo)adjuvant CT were ineligible. Pts were randomised 2:1 to IPAT (400 mg d1\u201321) + PAC (80 mg/m 2  d1, 8 & 15) on a 28 d cycle or placebo (PBO) + PAC until progression or unacceptable toxicity, stratified by (neo)adjuvant CT, prior PI3K/mTOR inhibitor and region. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed PFS. Results 146 pts were randomised to IPAT + PAC and 76 to PBO + PAC. Prior therapy was balanced between arms, with (neo)adjuvant CT in 55%, endocrine therapy for aBC in 46%, PI3K/mTOR inhibitor in 24% and CDK4/6 inhibitor in 26%. At data cut-off (17/1/20; median follow-up 12.9 mo) 21% of pts remained on therapy. Median investigator-assessed PFS was 9.3 mo in both arms (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.71\u20131.40). Median PFS by independent review committee was 9.2 mo with IPAT + PAC vs. 8.5 mo with PBO + PAC (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.56\u20131.13). In both arms, objective response rate was 47% and median response duration was 9.2 mo. Overall survival (OS) results are immature (deaths in 25%). Median PAC duration was 6.9 mo with IPAT + PAC vs. 8.8 mo with PBO + PAC; median duration of IPAT was 8.0 mo and PBO was 9.1 mo. IPAT + PAC was associated with more AEs leading to withdrawal of PAC (26% vs. 13%) or IPAT/PBO (11% vs. 4%). IPAT/PBO dose reductions were more common (34% vs. 8%) but PAC dose reductions (26% vs. 24%) and interruptions (53% vs. 51%) and IPAT/PBO interruptions (43% vs. 43%) were similar. No new safety signals were seen. The most common AEs were diarrhoea (85% vs. 37%; grade \u22653: 12% vs. 1%), alopecia (50% vs. 59%) and nausea (41% vs. 20%). Conclusions Adding IPAT to PAC did not improve efficacy in  PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN -altered HR+ aBC. The IPAT + PAC safety profile was consistent with known AEs of each agent. OS follow-up is ongoing.

Preclinical data suggests an activated RET pathway can contribute to endocrine resistance. The FURVA trial investigated whether the addition of vandetanib (v) to fulvestrant (f) improved progression-free survival in patients with aromatase inhibitor (AI) resistant advanced breast cancer. Methods FURVA is an investigator-led, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised phase II trial. AI resistant patients were recruited from 19 UK sites and randomly assigned (1:1) to fulvestrant 500mg (day 1 and 15 of cycle 1 and day 1 only of subsequent 28 day cycles) with either vandetanib 300mg (f+v) or placebo (f+p) daily until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), safety, and the influence of RET signalling pathway component expression (e.g. total RET immunostaining) on vandetanib activity. Results Between 20 Apr 2015 and 30 Oct 2017, 165 patients were randomised to f+v (n=80) or f+ p (n=85). In the Intention-to-treat analysis, after 138 events, median PFS was 5.5 months (m) for f+v compared to 5.5m for f+p (Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.88; 95% CI: 0.62 to 1.23; p = 0.22). Median OS was 19.5m for f+v compared to 19.9m for f+p (HR=0.92; 95% CI: 0.60 to 1.42; p = 0.71). Unexpectedly, high total RET protein expression was associated with a significant PFS advantage of 8.87m vs 3.94m in the low RET group (HR 0.493: 95% CI 0.32 to 0.77; p=0.002), which was independent of treatment arm. This was supported by an OS advantage 21.95m vs 18.04m (HR 0.584; 95% CI 0.34 to 1.00; p=0.051). High RET expression did not predict an advantage of vandetanib use. Toxicity data will be presented. Conclusions The trial has shown that addition of vandetanib to fulvestrant does not improve PFS significantly. However, in the pre-planned exploratory analysis, high total RET expression was significantly associated with improved PFS, suggesting RET may predict tumour sensitivity to fulvestrant in AI resistant disease.

Since the EORTC 2005 trial (Stupp et al.) standard treatment has been temozolomide in combination with radiotherapy. In Europe and the US many population-based cancer registries (CRs) gather data on treatment, which can be used to assess care patterns at population level. This analysis reports on GBM treatment in Europe and US in the period before and after the change in clinical practice. Methods Data from CRs contributing to the European Cancer Information System having submitted treatment information and data from the US National Cancer Institute Surveillance (NCI), Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) were analysed, selecting patients diagnosed in 1999-2013 with GBM as first tumour. The proportion of cases by treatment type was calculated for radiotherapy (RT) and RT plus systemic therapy (RT+ST) and overall survival was compared by period (1999-2003 vs 2009-2013) and area. Results 34,229 cases from 17 CRs in 11 European Countries \u2013 3 each in Eastern, Northern and Western Europe, 2 in Southern Europe \u2013 and 36,925 cases from 18 US CRs were analysed. In Europe 45% of cases received RT and 14% RT+ST in 1999-2003. The percentages were 28% RT, 32% RT+ST in 2004-2008 and 21% RT, 44% RT+ST in 2009-2013. Treatment modality distribution was similar in the four European areas. In the US therapy was RT for 38% and RT+ST for 27% of patients in 1999-2003. The percentages were 13% RT, 55% RT+ST in 2004-2008 and 9% RT, 62% RT+ST in 2009-2013. In Europe two-year overall survival was 10% for RT and 20% for cases with RT+ST in 1999-2003, rising to 25% for RT+ST in 2009-13. In the US it was 7% for RT cases and 13% for those with RT+ST in 1999-2003, rising to 9% for RT and 26% for RT+ST in 2009-2013. Conclusions A change in treatment modality for GBM was observed between the considered periods, showing that the switch to RT+ST modality has been more marked in the US. Two-year survival differences between patients treated with RT and those with RT+ST are similar in Europe and the US, showing that likely more European patients would benefit if the RT+ST percentage could rise to the US level. CRs could be a powerful tool to assist clinical research and monitor treatment patterns and effects in the population. Legal entity responsible for the study The authors.

From 1984-2012, there were around 200 new cases of malignant primary brain tumours each year in Hong Kong, and the trend has been static. To improve epidemiological reporting of CNS tumours in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Cancer Registry (HKCaR) has established the brain and CNS tumour registry (BCTR) to collect all incident cases of primary malignant and non-malignant CNS tumours since 2013. Methods The HKCaR is a population-based cancer registry in Hong Kong. Clinical records and pathology reports were obtained from public and private care providers with high coverage of 95%. These records were entered, cleansed and validated. Incidence of pathologically or clinically diagnosed CNS tumours with malignant, benign or uncertain behaviours were reported over the period of 2013-2017. The incidence were age-standardized with the 2000 US standard population and compared with US data from CBTRUS. Results The age-standardised incidence of malignant and non-malignant brain tumours pooled over the period of 2013 to 2017 were 3/100,000 population and 8.6/100,000 population respectively. The top three most common types of malignant neoplasms were glioblastoma, other glial tumours and embryonal tumours; and in non-malignant neoplasms being meningioma, pituitary tumours and nerve sheath tumours. The incidence of both malignant and non-malignant tumours were around half of that in the US (7.08 and 16.33 per 100,000 population in the period of 2012-2016). The incidence of non-malignant and malignant brain tumours both increases significantly with age, with steep increment for non-malignant tumours starting from age of 45-64 and for malignant after the year of 65. The incidence rate in the whole population and in each age group has remained static over the reported years. Conclusions Significant geographical differences in incidence of CNS tumours was observed between Hong Kong and the US. Under-diagnosis of brain tumour is unlikely due to easy access to public healthcare service and cross sectional imaging. The difference may be due to ethnic and environmental factors, which include higher rate of allergic conditions in Hong Kong which may confer protection. Further investigations are warranted.

We conducted a single centre prospective observational study investigating the association between SES and GBM survival in Italy, where exists a national health service that provides universal coverage. Methods This study was a prospective analysis of newly diagnosed GBM patients who underwent chemoradiation between 2018 and 2020 in a hub center for brain cancer research. The SES was measured using the income-brackets, extracted from regional health administrative system. The income-brackets refer to annual gross family income: up to 36,152 euros in income is classified as R1 bracket; between 36,153 and 70,000 euros as R2; between 70,0001 and 100,000 euros as R3; over 100,000 euros as R4. Results One hundred six patients were included in the study. In multivariable cox proportional hazard model of survival, a high available income was associated with improved survival HR= 0.623 (95% CI 0.467-0.832; p = 0.001). When adjusted for age, survival remained improved for high-income patients. Conclusions We confirm that SES is an important determinant of prognosis in GBM even in the Italian National Health Service which provide universal, largely free and relatively comprehensive healthcare. Despite aspirations to achieve equality in healthcare, socioeconomic differences exist and may impact on clinical outcome. Legal entity responsible for the study The authors.

Responses to bev remain brief; and resistance may involve overexpression of Fatty Acid Synthase (FASN). Methods We performed prospective phase 2 study of bev with oral FASN inhibitor TVB-2640 in patients with rGBM at first relapse. Primary end point was progression free survival (PFS) with comparison to bev single agent outcomes from BELOB. Inclusion criteria included adults with GBM progression following standard combined modality treatment. An exploratory phase randomization into 2 separate arms of single agent bev or in combination with TVB-2640 with MR-Spectroscopy (MRS) and serum sampling for exosome analysis was obtained on all patients at day 1 and 28 of first cycle. Starting on cycle 2 day 1, all patients converged to a single arm and continued to receive bev in combination with TVB-2640. Results A total of 28 patients were enrolled, 3 failed screening. 23 came off study and 2 are active. No grade 4 or higher treatment-related AEs have occurred, with Grade 3 events included 3 cases of palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia; 1 each of hypertension, stomatitis, optic neuritis, DVT, and wound infection. A 66.7% overall response rate (ORR) was observed and 95% of patients have achieved at least stable disease by RANO Criteria. Median time to progression was 5.9m, which was statistically superior to historical controls. Median overall survival (OS) was 10.1m with an OS12 of 40%. Biomarker analysis (exosome, MRS) is pending. Conclusions The combination of TVB-2640 with bev appears well tolerated with improved progression free and overall survival compared to historical controls. Additional studies are warranted.

DepatuxM is a new antibody-drug conjugate, consisting of a specific antibody against activated EGFR and a cytotoxic agent with antimicrotubule activity. The Intellance2/EORTC 1410 phase-II trial, showed interesting results for DepatuxM + TMZ combination in EGFRamplified glioblastoma patients at first recurrence after RT and TMZ. In our study, we investigated clinical outcome and safety of this combination used in recurrent GBM PTS as \u201ccompassionate use\u201d. Methods PTS were enrolled from 7 centres of AINO and followed prospectively. Major inclusion criteria were: histologically confirmed diagnosis of GBM, 1 or more prior systemic therapies, ECOG PS \u2264 2 and EGFRamplified (FISH). Patients received DepatuxM 1.25 mg/kg every two weeks + TMZ until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the survival curves, RANO criteria for radiological assessment, CTCAE v5.0 for drug related adverse events. Results From October 2018 to June 2019, we enrolled 36 PTS: median age was 57, ECOG PS 0-1 in 88% of PTS, MGMTmet in 64%, 42% received the treatment as second line therapy. At the time of analysis, 24 PTS (67%) had died and 31 PTS (86%) had progressed. Median OS was 8.04ms (95%CI 5.3-10.7), 12m OS was 37%; medianPFS was 2.1ms (95% CI 1.7-2.4), 6ms PFS was 38%. All PTS were evaluable for response: disease control rate was 47%: stable disease was reported in 36%, partial response in 11% and complete response in 3% of PTS. Drug-related adverse events led to dose reductions of DepatuxM in 17% of PTS, in 28% was delayed and in 5% was permanently discontinued. Grade 3 ocular toxicity occurred in 11% of patients, no grade 4 ocular toxicity was reported; no death was considered drug-related. Conclusions We report the first \u201creal world\u201d experience of DepatuxM + TMZ in recurrent GBM. We showed encouraging clinical benefit, despite most patients were treated beyond the second-line of therapy. Overall, the results are closed to those reported in previous phase II trial. Toxicity was moderate and manageable. This combination would be re-considered as a potential treatment for this setting of patients. Legal entity responsible for the study The authors.

The MGMT gene encodes an enzyme involved in DNA repair, the epigenetic silencing (by methylation) of which confers a better prognostic for GBM patients. We hypothesized that administration of folic acid could restore a methylation of MGMT promoter gene in non-methylated GBM and thus increase sensitivity to temozolomide combined with radiotherapy. Methods FOLAGLI is a non-randomized, phase 1 open study, with dose escalation (3+3 design) and expansion cohort of folic acid in combination with temozolomide and radiotherapy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma harboring non-methylated MGMT gene promoter detected by semi quantitative methyl-specific PCR. The study assessed the tolerability, pharmacodynamics and efficacy of folic acid dose escalation from 5 to 60 mg daily, given 30 minutes before temozolomide. Results Between March 2013 and March 2019, 90 patients were screened of whom 66 had a MGMT promoter methylated tumor. Finally, 24 patients were enrolled and one patient withdrew his consent. Median age was 56 years old [range 42-73]. No dose limiting toxicity was reported in the phase I part. The recommended dose for the expansion phase was 60 mg. Grade 1-2 treatment-related adverse events (AEs) occurring in \u22652 patients included asthenia (n=6), lymphopenia (n=2), nausea (n=3) and vomiting (n=3), alopecia (n=2) and anemia (n=2). Grade III AEs related to treatment occurring in \u22651 patients included lymphopenia (n=2), thrombocytopenia (n=1), neutropenia (n=1), dehydration (n=1) and hypoacousia (n=1). No grade IV AES occurred. With a median follow-up of 18.3 [8.5-65.5] months, median progression free survival (PFS) was 7.9m [7.1-8.3]. The median overall survival (OS) was 17.1m [12.6-24.5] and 6, 12 and 24 months OS rate were 100%, 79.8% [54.6-91.9] and 28.2 [9.2-51.2] respectively. For the eight patients with ctDNA monitoring, the combination of folic acid with temozolomide showed restoration of methylation on of the promoter of MGMT detected in ctDNA. Conclusions Preliminary safety and efficacy results suggest that folic acid combined with temozolomide and radiotherapy is well tolerated and feasible. Clinical trial identification NCT01700569.

We aimed to analyze the mutational profile between primary tumor and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained at recurrence in patients treated for a HGG. Methods This prospective pilot trial included patients suffering from HGG at the time of recurrence, defined by RANO criteria, after standard radiotherapy and temozolomide treatment. CSF (2mL) was collected by lumbar puncture within 3 weeks after recurrence MRI. ctDNA from CSF and DNA from primary tumor (tDNA) were both sequenced using next-generation sequencing (NGS) Illumina Miseq\u00ae with custom targeted panel dedicated to HGG hotspot mutations. Results Eighteen patients were included (16  IDH -wild type glioblastoma, 1 gliosarcoma and 1 anaplastic astrocytoma). Two-thirds (10/15) of patients had somatic mutations in CSF (ctDNA+) at recurrence (3 pts had insufficient ctDNA amount). Mutational profile differed between tDNA at baseline  versus  ctDNA at recurrence, especially regarding altered genes frequencies:  PTEN  37.5%  vs  26.7%,  TERT  43.8%  vs  20%,  TP53  13.3%  vs  20% and  ATRX  31.3% vs 13.3%. Interestingly, two patients harbored  de novo  driver mutations ( IDH2  and  MSH6)  in ctDNA at recurrence. Regarding factors associated with ctDNA+: 7/10 had CSF protein level >.55g/L with a mean of 1.17 g/L for ctDNA+  vs  .65 g/L for ctDNA-, p=.06. Whole circulating cell-free DNA concentration also correlated to CSF protein content (Rsquared 0.4, p=.003). The 1-year overall survival was 90% in ctDNA+ group and 40% in ctDNA- group. Conclusions ctDNA from CSF is a promising and minimally-invasive tool to characterize molecular evolution of HGG after RT-TMZ treatment in a subset of patients. Meningeal inflammation likely influences ctDNA detection in CSF. Legal entity responsible for the study The authors. Funding GIRCI Nord-Ouest. Disclosure M.

The development of systemic treatment approaches and their combination with local therapy have improved the prognosis of melanoma patients with brain metastases. However, only few contemporary cohorts of melanoma patients with leptomeningeal metastases (LM) have been reported. Methods We retrospectively reviewed files of 51 melanoma patients with newly diagnosed LM from 7 European centers. The clinical description, brain or cerebrospinal MRI, and CSF data at diagnosis had to be available. EANO ESMO criteria for LM were retrospectively applied. Results At LM diagnosis, median age was 60 years (interquartile range - IQR: 44-66), median Karnofsky performance score (KPS) was 70 (IQR: 60-90%). Clinical signs were noted in 44 patients (86%). CSF tumor cells were noted in 38 patiens (74%). The most frequent MRI presentation was linear disease (EANO ESMO type A) (n=21, 41%), then combined linear and nodular disease (EANO ESMO type C) (n=16, 31%). The diagnosis was confirmed for 39 patients (76%), probable for 10 (20%), possible in 2 (4%). A BRAF mutation was noted in 38 tumors (76%). Systemic treatment was administered in 23 patients (51%), including targeted therapy in 13 (56%) and immunotherapy in 3 (13%). Patients with BRAF-mutated tumors received systemic treatment in 22 cases (58%), including targeted therapy in 13 patients (59%). Intrathecal treatment was given in 23 patients (45%). Whole brain radiotherapy was used in 16 patients (31%), 33 patients (65%) had no brain radiotherapy. The combination of systemic and intrathecal treatment (n=13, 25%) was the most commonly used combination. No specific treatment was given to 11 patients (22%). Median OS for the whole cohort was 1.7 months (IQR: 0.9-5.2). Median OS was 1.5 months (0.8-4.3) in type I LM versus 2.2 months (1.5-8.1) in type II LM; 1.9 months (IQR: 0.9-4.5 months) in BRAF mutated tumors versus 4.6 (IQR:1.4-8.6) in the BRAF non-mutated tumors; and 1.4 (IQR: 0.5-1.6) without versus 2.9 months (IQR: 1-6) with treatment. Conclusions The prognosis of LM in melanoma patients remains poor despite novel systemic treatment options. New therapeutic approaches are urgently needed in this population.

SG utilizes a pH hydrolysable linker, allowing SN-38 to be released at the tumor site, making the drug accessible to surrounding tumor cells. The payload, SN-38, is a topoisomerase inhibitor which crosses the blood-brain barrier and is a drug partner in CNS regimens. We have observed SG activity in intracranial xenograft models. We therefore hypothesized that SG would achieve therapeutically relevant concentration of SN-38 within the CNS. Methods We initiated a prospective, single center, window of opportunity trial (NCT03995706) to examine the intra-tumoral concentrations of SG, SN-38, and SN-38G in patients undergoing craniotomy for breast cancer brain metastases (BCBM, n=10) or recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM, n=10). Patients received a single dose of SG at 10mg/kg IV the day prior to craniotomy. Tumor and corresponding serum were collected intra-operatively. Total SN-38 concentrations were analyzed via ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography\u2212high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS). Patients resumed SG 10mg/kg IV days 1 and 8 of 21 day cycle following recovery and were assessed every third cycle by MRI using RANO criteria. Results To date 14 patients have been treated, including 7 BCBM and 7 rGBM. No new safety signals have been observed. UHPLC-HRMS analysis was performed in the first 10 tumors (n=4 and 6 respectively). For the rGBM patients, total concentration of SN-38 varied from 93nM to 680nM, with a mean concentration of 420nM. For BCBM, total concentration of SN-38 varied from 173nM to 1160nM, with a mean concentration of 626nM. All GBM patients had residual measurable disease and 4 breast patients had measurable disease. With a median follow up of 12 weeks from the first postoperative cycle, we have observed 2 partial responses by RANO criteria within the brain from each group (ORR of 28% and 50% at 12 weeks respectively). Conclusions SG achieves therapeutically relevant concentrations of SN-38 at 40-fold mean IC50s for GBM, and 150-fold mean IC50s for BCBM. The early intracranial responses are encouraging and will be further evaluated in the Southwest Oncology Group S2007 study. Clinical trial identification NCT03995706.

However, there is no recommendation about OTT dose adaptation in the growing oncogeriatric population. Objective: To analyze in a real-life cohort the baseline prescribed dose of OTT in older cancer patients, and the reasons for dose modifications. Methods This non-interventional, retrospective study included patients \u226570 years old treated in our comprehensive cancer center between 02/2016 and 08/2019 for a metastatic cancer with one of our 6 most prescribed OTT. Oral chemotherapy agents were excluded. Data were extracted from patient medical record: age, type of OTT, initial dose, oncogeriatric evaluation, treatment duration and toxicity based on CTCAE version 5.0. Results 123 of 986 patients treat with OTT in our cohort were \u2265 70 years old and received one of the 6 selected OTT (Afatinib 15.4%, Everolimus 14.6%, Palbociclib 51.2%, Pazopanib 9.8%, Soraf\u00e9nib 5.7% and Sunitinib 3.2%). At baseline, the prescribed dose of OTT was lower than the recommended dose in 28 % of cases (35/123). Patients with baseline dose reduction were significantly older (mean age 80 years vs 74 years, p <0.001), and more frequently affected by a PS >0 (70%) compared to the standard dose group (55%), p < 0.01. However, only 8 patients had a formal oncogeriatric evaluation, 4 in standard dose group (4.5%) and 4 in baseline dose reduction group (11%). p=0.22. Higher toxicities grades were statistically more frequently reported in the recommended dose group (p= 0.035) leading to more subsequent dose reduction in this subgroup (40% of patients (35/88)) compared to the adapted dose cohort (20% of patients (7/35), p=0.037. At the end of study, 51% of patients of our entire cohort (63/123) received a lower dose than the recommended one. Conclusions Initial OTT dose adaptation appears frequent in our elderly cancer population (28%), however rarely based on a formal oncogeriatric evaluation (6.5%). In the absence of recommendation, clinical studies are necessary to evaluate the efficacy and safety of OTT dose reduction in this elderly population.

Deployment of telehealth solutions can help maintaining continuity of care while limiting pts' and healthcare workers\u2019 exposure with the virus. In this context, Gustave Roussy Cancer Institute has implemented a pts reported outcome platform (CAPRI-COVID) to improve monitoring and effective management of COVID-19 positive pts with cancer. Methods CAPRI-COVID consists in a mobile application (CAPRI App) and a telephone platform with a dedicated call number, the entire procedure being managed by four NNs. After an initial assessment by the NNs, remote monitoring of 6 COVID-related symptoms were collected daily, either by the patient via the CAPRI App or by NNs during a phone call. In case of worsening or emerging symptoms, an automated alert was sent to the platform; NN assessed the clinical condition and could ask for a medical advice if necessary. The monitoring period was 14 days (with at least 2 days with complete regression of symptoms). Each intervention performed by NNs was tracked on the platform, as well as pts-reported data. This analysis presents the data collected via the platform from March 23 to May 4 2020. Results Overall, 116 COVID-positive pts have completed the monitoring period (median age: 58.5 years, 21-90; 56.9% female). 54.3% were monitored after hospitalization for COVID-19, 37.1% after RT-PCR screening (symptomatic pts) and 8.6% for systematic screening prior to surgery. There were no deaths or admissions to intensive care unit. 7.8% of pts were hospitalized (excluding scheduled hospitalization). NNs conducted an average of 9.9 calls per patient. Of 53 events requiring a medical opinion, 50.9% resulted in a visit to the emergency room. 41.4% of pts downloaded the CAPRI App, and completed the tracking data on average 1.1 times per day. Conclusions CAPRI-COVID enabled to keep the majority of pts at home, and helped to ensure secure pts\u2019 pathways during this epidemic. NNs play an essential role in addition with the use of CAPRI App which helped limiting phone calls and focusing on the management of complex pts. Ongoing analyses are exploring actions of NNs and pts\u2019 experience. Legal entity responsible for the study Gustave Roussy. Funding Has not received any funding. Disclosure O.

However, the situation for YAs with brain tumors is largely unknown. The aim of this study was therefore to compare sexual dysfunction in YAs with brain tumors to those with other types of tumors. Furthermore, to investigate to what extent the YAs with brain tumors had discussed sexual issues with a health care professional. Methods The Fex-Can study is a population-based study investigating sexual function and fertility-related distress in YAs diagnosed with cancer in Sweden. All patients diagnosed with selected cancers (breast, testicular, cervix, ovarian, lymphoma) or brain tumors at age 18-39 years were identified via National Cancer Quality Registers and approached with a survey approximately 1.5 years after diagnosis. Sexual function was measured with the PROMIS SexFS. To compare proportions between groups, the \u03c7 2 -test or Fisher's Exact test were used. Results A total of 1010 participants (response rate 67%), 123 with brain tumors and 887 with other cancers participated. 41% of the men and 56% of the women with brain tumors reported at least one sexual dysfunction with most problems related to satisfaction with sex life, sexual interest and orgasm ability (only women). Overall, few differences were seen between YAs with brain tumors and YAs with other cancers, regardless of sex. Men with brain tumors reported lower sexual interest (30%) than men with other cancers (12%, p<0.01), whereas women reported less problem with vaginal lubrication (6%) compared to women with other cancers (22%, p<0.01). A majority (68%) of YAs with brain tumors did not recall any discussions of possible impact of the cancer on sex life with a health care professional compared to YAs with other cancers (21%, p<0.001). Conclusions Overall, few differences in sexual dysfunction were detected between YAs with brain tumors and other cancers, yet only 20% of the YAs with brain tumors remembered having talked to a caregiver about potential impact on their sex life. There is a need to routinely address sexual issues in clinical care. Legal entity responsible for the study Claudia Lampic and Lena Wettergren.

Immunotherapy is becoming one of the main options of treatment in many tumors, but at the cost of adverse events that differ from those of cytotoxic chemotherapy. These adverse events are related to the immune system (1). To control and manage these events, an interdisciplinary approach to the patient is essential, and it is the expert nurse who can provide specific care for the control and management of the symptoms with an exhaustive follow-up during the ambulatory and hospital process. (3,4). Methods A bibliographic review of relevant primary research and clinical guidelines in oncology was carried out with the key words: cancer treatment, immunotherapy, oncology, nursing care, immunotherapy-related adverse events, toxicities. An interdisciplinary working group was set up consisting of oncologists, internists and nurses, with a schedule of weekly meetings of approximately 60 minutes during the months of January and March of 2020. Results An algorithm has been developed for each most common toxicity to allow nursing staffto detect early signs/symptoms of the patient and classify them according to the degree of toxicity, depending on the organ affected (2) and according to the CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) classification. At the same time, these algorithms allow prescribing the necessary treatment for grade I and II adverse events. For grades III and IV, specific care plans were established. Therefore, nursing can carry out autonomous interventions to detect potential risk situations prevent possible complications. Conclusions The algorithm of multidisciplinary action provides an improvement in the approach in the different stages of the oncological process. It involves outpatient (consultation, Call Center, Immediate Care Consultation, Day Hospital) and hospitalization units. We believe its application can improve assessment, detection and treatment of the patient according to defined criteria, thus optimizing time and resources, improving quality of care, patient satisfaction and safety, and achieving excellence in care. It also promotes the autonomous role of the nurse and its value. Legal entity responsible for the study The authors. Funding Has not received any funding.

The variability in existing specialised cancer nursing education programs, regulation, and recognition across European countries raised the question of mapping the situation to strive for a common base using the EONS\u2019s Cancer Nursing Education Framework. The aim of this survey is to further explore the actual reality of educational programs and the recognition of cancer nursing as a specialty across Europe. Methods In 2019 a survey, covering ten items regarding cancer nursing education and recognition, was send out to cancer nurses of the WHO European Region countries. The items were: existence and type of specialty education, who provides it, title if education program completed, since when does it exist, duration of the program, structure of the program, modules of the education, number of ECTS, and recognition of the specialisation. Results From the 51, only 13 countries were responded (response rate 25.49%) and all reported the existence of specialised cancer nursing education programs, with a variation in type of education or training (master\u2019s programs, diplomas or other certificates) and the duration (between 200hrs to 6 years). Most of the programs are provided by academic institutes or university hospitals, and the first are aged since the decade of 80\u2019s (UK, Ireland). In only 5 countries the national authority recognised cancer nursing as a specialty. A second launch of the survey will be send out to identified cancer nurses from the missing countries to increase the response rate. Conclusions Specialised cancer nursing education is pivotal to guarantee equal high-quality cancer care for all patients across Europe. Innovation and complex cancer nurse-led interventions can only be delivered by well-educated and specialised cancer nurses. We need to further investigate what the actual situation is in order to promote cancer nursing as a specialty across Europe, based on a mutually agreed education framework.

Guidelines, education and access to Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) vary between countries and healthcare organizations. European Oncology Nursing Society\u2019s (EONS) Advocacy working group, set a strategic goal to raise awareness on patient safety. To gain knowledge on both patient- and occupational safety from European cancer nurses, a survey was conducted. Methods EONS Advocacy working group developed a survey on occupational and patient safety. The semi-structured survey consists of two parts; one with 20 items on occupational safety (with the option of free-text comments) and one validated tool (Hospital Survey on patient safety (HSPS), not analyzed here). The survey (translated into 8 languages) was anonymous and handed out at various national cancer nursing conferences, at EONS cancer nursing conference 2019 and online via EONS webpage (from October 2019 and onwards). A database was developed by the Regional Cancer Centre in Stockholm-Gotland, Sweden, dedicated for this survey. Quantitative and qualitative analysis methods were used to present the preliminary data findings. The survey will be open until August 2020. Results To date 491 cancer nurses from 38 European countries have responded. Preliminary analysis indicates differences between countries and institutions. Guidelines on management and administration of cytotoxic drugs is frequently reported, but these guidelines are not fully implemented and often not followed due to \u201cpressure at work\u201d, \u201clack of training\u201d, \u201clack of knowledge of health and safety risks\u201d and \u201cpeer pressure\u201d. Free-text responses highlight a number of safety related issues experienced by the nurses, and lack of support by organization and/or managers to follow and implement safe work processes. Conclusions Preliminary results indicate several challenges and areas for improvement in occupational and patient safety in Europe. Current practices and exposures suggest risk that is not acceptable. There is a need for a minimum standard practice regarding education and PPE on a European level and cancer nurses must be involved in the process. Legal entity responsible for the study The authors.

EONS Advocacy working group has developed the European Cancer Nursing Index (ECNI) to illustrate the status and better promote cancer nursing among political and/or health contexts. Methods Data on education and career development, patient and occupational safety, working conditions and impact, recognition and workforce statistics) were collected and (22 items) were divided into 5 dimensions (described above). from European cancer nurses through EONS survey on patient and occupational safety (n=491) and interviews conducted with leading cancer nurses (n=38). Eurostat and OECD work force statistics were also used. A scoring manual was developed (with scores 0- 100) by EONS Advocacy group. For items with varying responses from the same country, the most frequent was applied. Each of the 38 countries\u2019 national cancer profile was scored according to the manual and was presented graphically on map charts (mapchart.net). Results Important differences between countries regarding the 5 dimensions was found. The mean total cancer nursing index score was 48 out of 100 and varied between 16-78, with the highest reported total score was from Ireland (78/100). In education and career development (mean=9, min-max =0-18) Norway, United Kingdom, The Netherlands and Ireland scored higher, in Patient and Occupational safety (mean=18, min-max =3-36) Germany and Belgium, and recognition (mean=8, min-max =0-15) Cyprus, Denmark and Sweden, while Bosnia and Switzerland ranked higher on working conditions and impact (mean=15, min-max =3-19). Conclusions The ECNI 2020 provides important information on the differences in cancer nursing profile across Europe. Cancer nursing needs to be strengthened in all European countries, to guarantee high quality and safe cancer care. It is recommended that the index be updated biannually to reflect progress and future developments. Legal entity responsible for the study The authors. Funding Has not received any funding.
