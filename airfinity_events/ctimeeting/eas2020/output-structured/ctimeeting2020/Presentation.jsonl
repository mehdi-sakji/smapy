However, the prognosis of T2D patients with PAD remains poor as breakthrough therapies remain to be developed. Epigenetic modifications, namely DNA methylation and histone posttranslational modifications, are emerging as key players in cardiovascular disease.  Aim:  To investigate whether epigenetic changes modulate post-ischemic vascularization in experimental diabetes. Methods Experiments were performed in primary human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) exposed to hyperglycemia as well as in Lep db/db  mice carrying the genetic deletion of the methyltransferase SETD7 ( Setd7 -/- - Lep db/db ) .  Gastrocnemius muscle samples from patients with and without T2D were employed to translate our experimental findings. Results RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in glucose-treated HAECs revealed a profound upregulation of the methyltransferase SETD7, an enzyme involved in mono-methylation of lysine 4 at histone 3 (H3K4me1). Both SETD7 gene silencing and pharmacological inhibition by  (R) PFI-2 rescued hyperglycemia-induced impairment of HAECs migration and tube formation, while SETD7 overexpression blunted the angiogenic response. RNA-seq, ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) and ChIP assays showed that SETD7-dependent H3K4me1 regulates the transcription of the angiogenesis inhibitor semaphoring-3G (SEMA-3G). Indeed, SEMA-3G overexpression impaired angiogenic properties in SETD7-depleted HAECs. Endothelial sprouting was defective in aortas from Lep db/db  as compared to WT mice, whereas angiogenic response was preserved in  Setd7 -/- - Lep db/db  mice. Finally, SETD7/SEMA-3G axis was upregulated in muscle specimens from T2D patients. Conclusions Targeting SETD7 represents a novel epigenetic-based therapy to boost neovascularization in T2D patients with PAD.", "session_id": "fed503a5-087b-49a7-95b0-65a7d16d5ca3", "order": 42}

Recently we demonstrated that the deletion of macrophage NCOR1 aggravates the disease development by promoting CD36-triggered foam cell formation via PPARγ derepression. Since NCOR1 acts as a central regulator of hepatic lipid homeostasis, we speculated that its deletion in the liver will also affect atherosclerosis development. Methods To verify our hypothesis, we generated hepatocyte-specific  Ncor1  knockout mice on a  Ldlr -/- background. Besides assessing the progression of the disease in thoraco-abdominal aortas en face, we analyzed cholesterol and bile acid metabolism at expression and functional level. Results Our data demonstrate that liver-specific  Ncor1  knockouts develop less atherosclerotic lesions than control mice on an atherosclerosis-prone background. Interestingly, plasma cholesterol levels of liver-specific  Ncor1  knockout mice were higher compared to controls under chow diet, but lower after challenging mice with an atherogenic high-cholesterol diet for 12 weeks. Moreover, the content of hepatic cholesterol and triglycerides was decreased in liver-specific  Ncor1  knockout compared to control mice. This improved lipid profile is secondary to changes in liver bile acid species and an improved fecal excretion of sterols. Conclusions Our experiments suggest that NCOR1 exerts central functions in the regulation of cholesterol and/or bile acid synthesis, transport and excretion under different dietary conditions. Liver NCOR1 could therefore be a novel target for the development of anti-atherosclerotic drugs.", "session_id": "fed503a5-087b-49a7-95b0-65a7d16d5ca3", "order": 43}

Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed a that vascular risk loci include SMARCA4, a SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling gene important for gene activation. We tested whether SMARCA4 is has a patho-mechanism relevant to atherosclerosis. Methods We studied cultured human blood-derived macrophages, stimulated with heme or cyclic-AMP. Gene expression was by RT-qPCR by -2ΔΔCt, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) by our published methods. Results We describe an pathway that modifies chromatin in response to heme. This pathway includes early clearance of BACH1 repressor from the  HMOX1  enhancer, associated with the histone acetylation of the same site (H3K9Ac). This contrasted with gene-selective H3S10 phosphorylation of genes that respond to cyclic-AMP but not hemin (FOS and NR4A2). Interestingly, at the HMOX1 cis-regulatory sequence, chromatin looping and recruitment of SMARCA4 occurred prior to recruitment of p-ATF1, which we have shown is reuired for activation by hemin. Knockdown of SMARCA4 suppressed p-ATF1 binding to HMOX1 but increased its binding to the cyclic-AMP response elements of the enhancers for FOS and NR4A2. This resulted in suppressed HMOX1 mRNA levels, but increased mRNA levels for FOS and NR4A2. Downstream, si-SMARCA4 allowed heme to induce PLA2G7, which encodes platelet-activating-factor acetyl hydrolase (PAF-AH). Conclusions These data point to a role for SMARCA4 in chromatin remodelling in advance of ATF1, with the ability to alter its preferred target genes. Taken together, these data indicate that SMARCA4, an atherosclerosis risk gene, is associated with a novel mechanism key to switching between leukocyte-resolution and erythrocyte-resolution.", "session_id": "fed503a5-087b-49a7-95b0-65a7d16d5ca3", "order": 44}

But whether they impact lesion dynamics is currently unknown. We investigated the therapeutic value of exosomes produced by M2-like macrophages in controlling inflammation and atherosclerosis in mice. Methods Using cushioned-density gradient ultracentrifugation, exosomes were isolated from conditioned medium of cultured naïve bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM-exo) and BMDM exposed to interleukin 4 (IL-4) to polarize them into an M2 phenotype (BMDM-IL-4-exo). Results Our results show that BMDM-IL-4-exo reduced  Tnf  and  Il1b mRNA  expression in recipient cultured BMDM and enhanced mitochondrial oxidative metabolism that fostered their M2 differentiation. Infusions of BMDM-IL-4-exo into  Apoe –/–  mice fed a western diet reduced myeloid cells in the circulation by controlling hematopoiesis in the bone marrow. This profoundly altered the inflammatory profile of Ly-6C hi  monocytes and increased M2 marker expression in peritoneal macrophages. BMDM-IL-4-exo also reduced the necrotic core and numbers of macrophages in aortic root lesions. To identify molecular mechanisms responsible for these protective effects, we performed unbiased RNA sequencing of BMDM exosomes which revealed that BMDM-IL-4-exo are enriched in microRNA-99a/146b/378a. Gene editing to selectively knock down these microRNA in macrophages resulted in exosomes that were less effective in reducing NF-ĸB signaling and levels of TNFa in recipient macrophages. Conclusions Our findings reveal that M2-like macrophage exosomes are potent anti-inflammatory mediators through the delivery of select microRNA to recipient cells. Therefore, further engineering macrophage exosomes with microRNA targeting inflammatory pathways could provide a therapeutic approach to control atherosclerosis.", "session_id": "fed503a5-087b-49a7-95b0-65a7d16d5ca3", "order": 46}

A better understanding of the mechanisms controlling the recruitment of leukocytes to the lesion, a limiting step of inflammation, is paramount for the development of better therapies.   Aim: Identify endothelial miRNAs that modulated recruitment of leukocytes to inflammatory regions to gain a better understanding of cell adhesion modulatory mechanisms. Methods A functional high-throughput screening (HTS) using a robotic platform was performed to identify miRNAs modulating monocyte adhesion using a library of human miRNA mimics. Additional analysis were performed in order to validate identified targets. Results Functional HTS and validation screening identified 38 miRNAs decreasing monocyte adhesion. We observed that miRNA-induced reduction of monocyte adhesion was partially mediated by downregulation of inflammatory genes such as VCAM1 or ICAM-1 in response to TNF-α or IL-1β stimulation. Computational analysis identified potential pathways mediating thess effects for a reduced number of miRNA candidates. These pathways included actin cytoskeleton modulators (Ras small GTPases) and important mediators of inflammatory signaling transduction pathways. Lastly, we confirmed miRNA-mediated gene downregulation of several of these potential mediators which could explain the reduced inflammatory response of endothelial cells under these conditions. Conclusions We identified miRNAs able to modulate monocyte cell adhesion under inflammatory conditions.

The Cluster II of the LRP1 receptor, and in particular the C-terminal half of domain CR9, comprising the region Gly 1127 -Cys 1140  (P3 peptide), is critical for interaction with agLDL. The P3 peptide, and its stabilized versions, the DP3 retro-enantiomer, inhibits the process of aggregation of LDL by 80-90% in standardized biochemical assays. The objective of this work was to study the effect of DP3 peptide on the formation of foam cells and atherosclerosis in an  in vitro  and  in vivo  model, respectively. Methods The effectiveness of the DP3 peptide in inhibiting foam cell formation from hcVSMC was analyzed by chromatographic analysis of intracellular lipids and confocal microscopy. The impact of treatment with DP3  in vivo  was studied in knockout mice for LDLR to which the peptide was injected subcutaneously during 21 days. Plasma lipid levels were analyzed in an autoanalyzer. The atherosclerosis load in the aortic arch was immunohistochemically. Results In the presence of DP3, LDL was not aggregated and did not increase the intracellular accumulation of cholesterol in hcVSMC above physiological levels. These results were confirmed by confocal microscopy experiments. Optical microscopy showed that treatment with the peptide did not alter the viability of the cells. In the murine model, DP3 significantly reduced atherosclerosis induced by a high cholesterol diet. Conclusions Peptides derived from LRP1 emerge as potentially useful tools in the treatment of atherosclerosis, particularly in people with LDL prone to aggregation.", "session_id": "b0d72ff3-3334-4e8b-8a78-7c033493debd", "order": 50}

Methods We used apoCIII knockout (KO) rabbits generated by zinc finger nuclease technique and compared the plasma lipids and their susceptibility to a cholesterol diet-induced atherosclerosis with wild-type (WT) rabbits. Results On a normal chow diet, apoCIII KO rabbits exhibited lower plasma levels of TG (up to 36% reduction) than WT rabbits while total cholesterol (TC) and HDL-cholesterol levels were unchanged. Analysis of lipoproteins isolated by sequential gradient ultracentrifugation revealed that reduced plasma TG levels in KO rabbits were accompanied by 73% reduction of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) and 57% reduction of intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDLs). Furthermore, KO rabbits showed faster clearance rate of intralipid emulsion than WT rabbits. On a cholesterol-rich diet, KO rabbits exhibited constantly lower plasma TC and TG levels than WT rabbits, owing to a remarkable reduction of β-VLDLs, IDLs and LDLs. Aortic atherosclerosis areas were significantly reduced in KO rabbits compared with WT rabbits. Using DiI-labeled β-VLDLs, we found that deletion of apoCIII in β-VLDLs of KO rabbits enhances their uptake by cultured hepatocytes  in vitro  and exhibited faster clearance  in   vivo  than β-VLDLs of WT rabbits. Conclusions These results indicate that apoCIII deficiency facilitates TG-rich lipoprotein catabolism and protects against cholesterol diet-induced atherosclerosis in KO rabbits.

Aims:   This study aims at evaluating the spectrum of genetic factors that drive LDL-c to very low levels in order to: i) assess consequences on plasma lipids and liver enzymes and ii) identify polygenic FHBL patients for genetic research purposes. Methods 127 patients with LDL-c<5 th  percentile adjusted for age and sex were recruited. Targeted-next generation sequencing was performed to screen for monogenic forms of FHBL. A 12-SNPs polygenic risk score (PRS) has been calculate for all patients and 856 matched-population controls. Chronic liver disease was assessed by liver panel test (ALT, AST, GGT). Results 41(32%) patients carried a monogenic FHBL.

We sought to compare and to estimate the magnitude of the expected clinical benefit per unit reduction in apoB for several classes of lipid-lowering therapies. Methods We conducted a study-level meta-analysis of randomized trials evaluating statins, ezetimibe, PCSK9-inhibitors, CETP-inhibitors, niacin, and fibrates. We included all studies reporting apoB levels and cardiovascular (CV) outcomes, with at least 1000 participants and 1-year follow-up. The primary outcome was major CV events (MACEs). We estimated the relative risk (RR) of MACEs, adjusted for study duration, for each class and in a combined analysis. Results Twenty-five trials that enrolled 285,241 participants (mean age: 63.3 years; female sex: 24.7%) who experienced 40,244 first MACEs were included. The mean absolute difference in apoB between the treatment and comparison groups at 1 year was 24.1 mg/dL. The pooled RR per 30 mg/dL reduction in apoB levels was 0.79 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.77-0.81) for MACEs, consisting of significant risk reduction in non-fatal myocardial infarction (RR 0.76; 95%CI 0.73-0.79), coronary revascularisation (0.78; 0.73-0.82), stroke (0.79; 0.76-0.81), and CV death (0.87; 0.82-0.92).

Increasingly, patients with a clinical suspicion of FH are being offered genetic testing as part of diagnosis. However, determining pathogenicity of identified DNA variants remains a major challenge; this process is often rudimentary and differs among laboratories. To improve accuracy, concordance and standardization, the ClinGen FH Variant Curation Expert Panel (VCEP) has been tasked with developing FH-specific variant interpretation guidelines, derived from American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) recommendations (2015). Methods Following review of ACMG/AMP recommendations, the FH VCEP met through frequent emails and conference calls to propose FH-specific modifications. After multiple preliminary iterations, pilot testing, debate and further commentary, consensus among experts was reached. Results Here, we present a consensus set of FH-ACMG/AMP guidelines, which focus first on the LDL receptor gene ( LDLR) , and include: 1) indications for loss-of-function variant types; 2) functional study criteria specifications; 3) alteration of population data frequency thresholds; 4) specific use and thresholds for  in silico  prediction tools; and 5) co-segregation criteria specifications. Conclusions Establishment of these guidelines will help to achieve a more evidence-based, standardized method for the classification of variants detected in FH patients worldwide. Ultimately, all ~3000 FH-associated variants currently deposited in the ClinVar database will be re-classified using the FH-ACMG/AMP criteria, while promoting these guidelines as the new “gold standard” for variant classification among the FH community will ensure novel variants identified in real-time are appropriately evaluated.", "session_id": "0d65ee87-8723-4da7-8efb-073df41bd82f", "order": 57}

Methods 10 FH patients with an indication for lipid lowering treatment (LLT) (statin, PCSK9-antibody or both) as primary prevention were included. Transcriptomic and functional analyses of BM HSPCs and peripheral monocytes were performed at baseline and after 12 weeks of LLT. Results were compared to healthy controls matched for age, sex and BMI. Results Untreated FH patients have more CD34+ HSPCs with decreased expression of homing marker CXCR4, and more CCR2+ monocytes in the bone marrow compared to healthy controls. Transcriptomic analyses of untreated FH patients versus controls showed increased expression of genes involved in the migration and proliferation of HSPCs. Expression of genes involved in these pathways were partly reduced after LLT, with concomitant functional reduction in myeloid progenitor capacity. This reduction coincided with increased oxidative phosphorylation in CD34+ HSPCs measured on gene expression level, as well as with functional Seahorse analyses. Interestingly, these changes on bone marrow level did not result in a reduction of CCR2 expression measured by flow cytometry in circulating monocytes. Conclusions Hypercholesterolemia in untreated FH patients results in functional alterations of HSPC behavior, favoring the production of pro-inflammatory monocytes.

The goal of this study was to determine the role of Grx1 in monocyte and macrophage function and atherogenesis. Methods We transplanted bone marrow from wild-type or Grx1 knockout mice into atherosclerosis-prone LDLR-null mice and fed the mice a HCD for 20 weeks. To examine if Grx1 overexpression protects against HCD-induced monocyte dysfunction, macrophage reprogramming, and atherosclerosis, hematopoietic progenitor cells were transduced with lentiviral vector carrying a CD68 promoter-driven Grx1-IRES-EGFP (Grx1 Mac tg ) or EGFP-only (EGFP Mac tg ) construct and transplanted into LDLR-null mice. The mice were fed a HCD for 20 weeks. Results Mice with hematopoietic Grx1 deficiency (Grx1 leuko ) were 14% heavier than control mice and developed hyperglycemia. Atherosclerotic lesions were 31% larger in Grx1 leuko  mice than in control mice. Grx1-deficient macrophages were hyperchemotactic, more susceptible to oxysterol-induced cell death, and showed hyper-inflammatory activation in response to INFγ+TNFα and impaired inflammation resolving activity in response to IL-4. In contrast, Grx1 Mac tg  mice showed a 56% reduction atherosclerotic lesion compared to EGFP Mac tg  mice and restored macrophage function. Furthermore, nutrient-stress-induced protein  S -glutathionylation was suppressed by Grx1 overexpression, activity of MKP-1, a master regulator of macrophage function, was restored and the induction of glycolytic, proinflammatory PKM2 and Glut1 were prevented in monocytes from Grx1 Mac tg  mice compared to EGFP Mac tg  mice.

It remains unclear whether M1 (inflammatory) or M2 (resolving) macrophages have differing lipid-handling capacities when they arise from Intermediate (CD14 + CD16 + ), non-classical (CD14 dim CD16 + ) or classical (CD14 + CD16 - ) monocytes.   Aims:  To determine the lipid-handling and metabolic phenotype of macrophages derived from different human monocyte subsets and to examine this in a mouse model of atherosclerosis. Methods Methods:  Classical, intermediate and non-classical monocytes were differentiated into M1- or M2-macrophages and challenged with oxLDL. Cell metabolism and cholesterol efflux was analysed.  W estern-type diet fed  Apoe -/-  mice were used to study macroiphage metabolism ex vivo. Results Results:  M2-macrophages from all human monocyte subsets express lipid uptake genes ( CD36, SR-A, and LOX-1 ), and took up oxLDL, M1-macrophages did not. Following oxLDL loading, M2-macrophages from classical and intermediate monocytes displayed upregulated  ABCA1  and effluxed cholesterol to apoA-I. This was not observed in M2-macrophages derived from non-classical monocytes. In these M2-macrophages, glycolytic capacity was increased at the expense of mitochondrial activity following oxLDL loading. This phenotype was confirmed in CD206 +  M2-macrophages in aortic arch of  Apoe -/-  mice. In man and mouse, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) was increased in M2-macrophages which was lionked to a defect in cholesterol efflux. Lipidomics and functional analysis revealed de novo ceramide synthesis was responsible for the defect in cholesterol efflux from the non-classical monocytes-derived M2-macrophages, the inhibitor myriocin reversed this. Conclusions Conclusion: N on-classical monocyte derived M2-macrophages likely become foam cells. This is caused by mitochondrial dysfunction. Restoring mitochondrial function restores cholesterol efflux potential and could aid in atherosclerotic lesion regression.", "session_id": "34a1f58b-bfdd-42b4-b206-79105f559186", "order": 64}

We tested Adoptive Cell Therapy (ACT) with Treg engineered to selectively migrate in the atherosclerotic plaque and dampen the immune-inflammatory response in the arterial wall. Methods WT Treg were retrovirally (IRES-EGFP vector) transfected with a specific chemokine receptor or empty vector and i.v. injected (2x10 5  GFP + cells/mouse) in 8-week high-cholesterol diet (WTD) fed male LDLR-KO to drive Treg selectively to the plaque. Homing of engineered Treg to the plaque, atherosclerosis progression and plaque composition was analysed by flow cytometry, histology and shotgun proteomics. Results Plaque chemokines mRNA profiling showed that CX3CL1 is selectively expressed in the aorta but not in other districts (lymphonods, liver) of LDLR-KO while this is not the case for CCL2,CCL4, CCL5 and others. 24h after ACT, CX3CR1-Treg were detected in the aorta (2.5% of GFP+/lived cell compared to 0.6% of ctrl-Treg) of LDL-R KO mice, while a similar distribution in other tissues between CX3CR1-Treg and ctrl-Treg was observed. This results indicate that the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 axis preferentially vehiculate Treg to the plaque and therefore the effect of ACT with engineered Treg on atherosclerosis progression, was tested in LDLR-KO mice. ACT with CX3CR1-Treg reduced plaque progression (-40%,p<0.05) and lipid deposition (-11%,p<0.05), ameliorated plaque stability (collagen increased by +27%,p<0.05) and decreased the number of pro-inflammatory macrophages.

MAP1LC3A and MAP1LC3B play a key role in autophagy activity and have been implicated as prognostic factors in several human cancers. However, data on the involvement of autophagy in human atherosclerotic disease and plaque vulnerability are still sparse and completely lacking with regards to the involvement of MAP1LC3.   Aim:  To characterize MAPLC3 involvement during plaque progression and plaque vulnerability. Methods Mouse models of atherosclerosis and plaque rupture, human tissues from two different carotid plaque biobanks   as well as primary human carotid smooth muscle cells were analysed by different histological, immunofluorescent, cell and molecular approaches. Results In  in vivo  models, we show that  Map1lc3a  mRNA is downregulated but no change in  Map1lc3b  expression during the progression of atherosclerosis in hypercholesterolemic mice. Using two independent biobanks of human carotid atherosclerotic plaques ,  we observe that  MAP1LC3A  mRNA and protein levels are decreased in plaques from patients with symptomatic disease compared to asymptomatic. Notably,  MAP1LC3A  mRNA levels strongly correlate with vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) markers, while  MAP1LC3B  does not. Upon vascular hyperplasia, induced by balloon-injury, Map1lc3a is downregulated. Preliminary  in vitro  studies show that silencing of  MAP1LC3A  affects VSMC phenotypic switch. Further analyses of migration, proliferation and cell death parameters are ongoing.

We have previously observed that global deficiency of MC1-R signaling perturbed cholesterol homeostasis and increased arterial leukocyte accumulation in ApoE -/-  mice. Therefore, we aimed at investigating the contribution of leukocyte MC1-R to the development of atherosclerosis in ApoE -/-  mice. Methods ApoE -/-  mice were irradiated and received bone marrow (BM) cells from either ApoE -/-  or MC1-R deficient ApoE -/-  MC1-R e/e  mice. After 6 weeks of recovery, mice were maintained on chow diet or placed on western-type (HFD) diet for 10 weeks and analyzed for leukocyte counts in the blood, spleen and aorta by flow cytometry. Plaque size and composition in the aortic root were determined. Tissue expression of inflammatory markers was also assessed by qPCR and Western blotting. Results ApoE -/- MC1-R e/e  engrafted mice showed significantly elevated leukocyte counts in the blood and spleen in both chow- and HFD-fed groups. This was primarily due to increased lymphocyte count, specifically in CD4 +  T cells. Aortic lymphocyte count was also increased in chow-fed mice, while no differences were observed after HFD. Unexpectedly, ApoE -/- MC1-R e/e  mice showed down-regulation of pro-inflammatory markers in the spleen and aorta, an affect that was more pronounced in the HFD group. Despite robust leukocytosis, plaque size and composition were unaffected by leukocyte MC1-R deficiency.

Results The influence of heart muscle contraction (including increasing heart rate with exercise) and changes in artery wall thickness, evidenced in vascular remodelling, is discussed in relation to shear and artery stress distribution with links to atherosclerosis progression made.

Since, diabetes accelerates atherosclerosis development, we have extended this approach by applying scRNA-seq to all aortic cells with the specific aim to identify cell specific gene expression signature of the diabetic aorta. Methods Diabetes was induced with streptozotocin and mice were followed for 10 weeks. Cells from digested aortae were FACS-sorted for viable and metabolically active cells. These cells were loaded on the Chromium Single Cell Controller (10X Genomics) to generate single cell and gel bead emulsion. ScRNA-seq libraries were prepared with Single Cell 3’ Solution V2 kit (10X Genomics) and sequenced with Illumina Nova-seq 6000.

The efficiency of current available treatments is however limited, and a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying pathological processes is thus demanded. Lipases and lipoproteins play a central role in maintaining a balanced triglyceride turnover. A heterogenous lipoprotein fraction carries apolipoprotein M (apoM) which in return binds Sphingosine-1-Phosphate (S1P). Both mediators play a role in energy metabolism. Their exact contribution is however elusive, and thus addressed by the present study.  Methods We investigated by 10-fold increased plasma apoM and 1-fold increased S1P levels in a transgenic mouse model. Molecular processes related to glucose and fat metabolism were thereby emphasized. Results Most striking, elevated apoM/S1P levels delayed plasma triglyceride turnover by 80%. Analyses of molecular processes, centrally involved in triglyceride clearance, revealed reduced lipase activities as the primary underlying cause. Administration of FTY720, a S1P analogue, reduced the triglyceride clearance rate substantially, thus suggesting a S1P mediated effect. Changes in tissue-specific lipid uptake were additionally evident.  Conclusions We conclude that S1P is a potent regulator of plasma triglyceride clearance, whereas apoM plays a vital role in S1P transport. In line with previous studies, the apoM/S1P system is thus a considerable target to reduce plasma triglycerides in human subjects.", "session_id": "2801f5a1-69bc-4e6f-90cb-b742ca62ec00", "order": 74}

Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a key enzyme in TRL metabolism and facilitates hydrolysis of circulating TRLs. The LPL regulatory system consists of several complex and dynamic mechanisms. Different proteins may inhibit or promote LPL activity at different stages: from protein synthesis and folding to transport and final hydrolytic action at the capillary lumen.   Previous studies of LPL regulation have mainly been performed in non-physiological settings, using knockout/overexpression in animal models, or by in vitro experiments adding supraphysiological concentrations. In this study, we wanted to examine the association between physiological LPL regulator levels and activity in the plasma compartment. Methods Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we performed an LPL activity assay using plasma samples from 117 fasted individuals. The assay allows direct measurement of lipoprotein hydrolysis using a standardised amount of LPL. Additionally, we measured plasma concentrations of seven known LPL regulators with ELISA. The plasma lipidome was profiled with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Results Physiological variation in the levels of apolipoprotein C1, C2 or C3, and angiopoietin-like protein 3, 4 or 8 showed no significant association with LPL activity (Figure 2C). Instead, LPL activity was strongly associated with characteristics of the plasma lipidome, such as the average very low-density lipoprotein particle size and the lipid content in different lipoprotein subclasses (Figure 3A-B).

Using advanced lipoprotein testing, we examined lipid and lipoprotein profiles of HTG patients with and without HTGP to identify differences and diagnostic markers. Methods We retrospectively reviewed charts of adults with serum TG ≥ 500 mg/dL who had undergone advanced lipoprotein testing between 2005–2018. Chi-square or rank-sum tests were used to compare patients with and without HTGP within 1 year of testing. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to examine the value of lipid and lipoprotein parameters in discriminating between the two groups. Results Of 58 patients analyzed, 20 had at least one instance of HTGP. Median serum and chylomicron TG values were higher in HTGP patients vs. controls (2832 mg/dL vs. 978 mg/dL; 1255 mg/dL vs. 266 mg/dL respectively, p < 0.001).

Methods Macrophage cholesterol efflux induced in vitro by LDL added to the culture media either alone or together with HDL, or  ex vivo  by plasma derived from subjects with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) was assessed.  In vivo  m-RCT was evaluated in CETP lacking mouse models of hypercholesterolemia fed a Western-type diet. Results LDL facilitated the removal of radiolabeled UC from cultured macrophages, and, in the simultaneous presence of HDL, a rapid transfer of the radiolabeled UC from HDL to LDL occurred. However, LDL did not exert a synergistic effect on the CEC of HDL or of FH plasma. The m-RCT rates of radiolabeled UC for LDL receptor (LDLr)-KO, LDLr-KO/apoB-100, and PCSK9-overexpressing mice were all significantly attenuated compared with those of wild-type mice. In contrast, the m-RCT rate remained unchanged in apoB-100 overexpressing transgenic mice with fully functional LDLr, despite increased levels of plasma apoB-containing lipoproteins. Conclusions We conclude that hepatic LDLr contributes to the flow of macrophage-derived UC to feces in mice, while hyper-apoB lipoproteinemia per se is unable to further stimulate the m-RCT.

In vivo  data supporting these effects on monocytes in patients are lacking. Here, we evaluated whether low levels of HDL-C determined by genetic mutations (e.g.  ABCA1, APOA1 and LCAT)  are associated with monocyte activation in humans. Methods We compared the monocyte phenotype from subjects with low-HDL (either ABCA1, apoA-I or LCAT deficient) to normolipidemic healthy controls. We used flow cytometry, measured intracellular lipid content as well as used functional read-outs such as trans-endothelial migration capacity and cytokine production. Finally, we studied RNA expression of pivotal inflammatory as well as cholesterol homeostasis genes. Results We found that apoA-I and ABCA1 deficiency associate with a pro-inflammatory monocyte phenotype with increased levels of activation markers, increased cytokine production and transendothelial migration capacity compared to controls. Baseline expression of IL-1b was increased. In contrast, LCAT deficiency shows an opposite phenotype with reduced transendothelial migration capacity and increased expression of efflux receptors. This is accompanied by a decreased cytokine production capacity and lower activation markers. Conclusions Different HDL-genotypes are associated with lead opposite monocyte immunophenotypes, resulting in either pro- or anti-inflammatory monocytes.

Methods Human monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells differentiated into macrophages with PMA were incubated for 34 h without (control cells) or with 70 μM EPA, 50 μM AA or 15 μM DHA. After an overnight treatment with LXR/RXR agonists, the isotopic cholesterol efflux promoted by lipid-free apolipoprotein AI (apo AI) was determined after 4 h of incubation with macrophages. Results AA and DHA supplementation had no significant effect, whereas EPA induced a dose-dependent increase of ABCA1 functionality (+18% for 70 mM of EPA), without any alterations in ABCA1 expression. The EPA-treated macrophages exhibited strong phospholipid composition changes, with high levels of both EPA and its elongation product docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) (C22:5 n-3), which was associated with a decreased level of AA.

Despite its system-wide relevance for human health, the molecular mode of action of HDL signalling is not known in detail. Due to the complexity of this particle we hypothesise that multiple receptors participate in HDL signalling, which together assemble to form a condition- and particle-dependent HDL synapse at the cell surface. Methods A newly in-house developed proximity labelling strategy termed LUX-MS enables the characterisation of complex ligand-receptor interactions. Receptors proximal to a cell surface bound ligand are tagged in a light-dependant manner and subsequently identified by mass spectrometry. Using LUX-MS we elucidated the HDL synapse, composed of the cell bound HDL proteome and its surrounding receptors, on an endothelial model system. Results We identified several HDL proteins, among these APOA1. Furthermore, we identified the known HDL receptor SCARB1 and other novel potential HDL interactors. A substantial number of these candidates were identified in a LUX-MS experiment directly targeting SCARB1 through an antibody, indicating that we captured the SCARB1 environment in the HDL synapse snapshot on endothelial cells. Conclusions We propose a new screening strategy to map the complex HDL interaction network at the cell surface. Our data supports the concept of an HDL synapse and receptor candidates are currently undergoing functional validation to prove their relevance in HDL signalling. These findings could provide the basis for the development of therapeutic modulators targeting new HDL receptors to improve prevention of coronary heart disease.", "session_id": "3029db6e-cb92-4dd3-8b4e-e9de4a5e777e", "order": 107}

A particular hiatus in our knowledge lies in the effects of sex hormones on this HDL function. The aim has been to evaluate the effects of exogenous sex hormones administration on HDL cholesterol efflux capacity (HDL-CEC) within transpeople. Methods 12 women underwent transition to men (transmen) by treatment with a mix of testosterone esters or testosterone undecanoateand; 10 men underwent transition to women (transwomen) by treatment with 17β estradiol. HDL-CEC was evaluated by radioisotopic technique. Lipid and hormone levels were measured. Results In transmen testosterone increased upon exogenous testosterone supplementation (+ 96%; p <0.001), while LH decreased (-68%; p = 0.05). At baseline a normal lipid profile was found, a feature not modified by testosterone except for the increased TG (+11.76%; p = 0.03). Concerning HDL-CEC, only the aqueous diffusion (AD) process decreased (-8.2%; p = 0.024). In transwomen 17β-estradiol supplementation increased estradiol levels (+245%, p=0.034) and decreased that of LH and testosterone (- 96%, p=0.004 and -97%, p<0.0001). The baseline normal lipid profile was not modified by 17β-estradiol except for the reduction in total cholesterol (-11.1%, p=0.009) and HDL-C (- 19%, p=0.001). Total HDL-CEC decreased (- 11%, p=0.004) with a specific decrement in ABCA1- (-21%, p=0.003) and AD-mediated CEC (-7%, p=0.004) independently of HDL-C impairment. Conclusions In transmen testosterone supplementation did not change HDL-C levels and associated to a reduction in AD-mediated HDL-CEC. In transwomen, estrogen led to a significant decrease in HDL-CEC-related function independently of HDL-C changes.", "session_id": "3029db6e-cb92-4dd3-8b4e-e9de4a5e777e", "order": 108}

While previous studies have shown the atherogenicity of Lp(a) on monocyte activation and migration as well by activation of the vessel wall, the atherosclerotic plaque phenotype of individuals with elevated Lp(a) levels have not been studied up till now.  Methods Therefore, we measured Lp(a) levels in 1506 subjects of the Athero-Express Biobank located at the University Medical Centre Utrecht, The Netherlands. Athero-Express started in 2002 and is a prospective ongoing biobank study that includes all patients undergoing carotid or iliofemoral endarterectomy in two referral hospitals in the Netherlands. From these 1506 subjects we compared the plaques from patients with extremely high (>195 mg/dl; N=57) and low (<7 mg/dl; N=106) Lp(a) levels.  Results The plaques from Lp(a) high patients demonstrated a 33% increase in blood vessel area per plaque, indicating an increased plaque angiogenesis. Intraplaque neovascularization has been shown to drive the progression of atherosclerosis and enhance plaque instability leading to an increase in cardiovascular risk.  Conclusions By using whole plaque RNA sequencing, combined with immunohistochemistry and targeted plasma biomarker analysis by OLINK proteomic panels, we aim to further characterise the plaque phenotype in patients with elevated levels of Lp(a) and thereby provide more insight in the atherogenic potential of Lp(a).

The endothelium is the first line of defence against pro-inflammatory changes in the artery wall. Recent evidence suggested that lipids may induce a pro-inflammatory state by altering intracellular metabolic responses. Therefore, we hypothesized that Lp(a) mediates endothelial inflammation via metabolic reprogramming, facilitating a pro-inflammatory environment, thereby driving monocyte migration through the vessel wall. Methods RNAseq, Metabolic-Flux-Analysis, TEM, qPCR, atherosclerosis-biobank Results In-depth RNA-sequencing of Human Arterial Endothelial Cells (HAECs) stimulated with Lp(a) significantly induced inflammatory pathways involved in efficient leukocyte adhesion and migration. This was confirmed by targeted qPCR, attested by a significant increase in leukocyte adhesion molecules MCP-1, ICAM-1, VCAM-1 (2.9, 5.0 and 3.1-fold increase in gene-expression, respectively) with a concomitant 7.1-fold increase in monocyte transendothelial migration (TEM).This inflammatory endothelial phenotype coincided with increased expression of key glycolytic genes PFKFB3, HK2 and PFKM (2.9, 2.3 and 2.1-fold increase respectively), whereas glycolytic flux analysis corroborated an 85% increase in glycolytic activity. Pharmacological inhibition of inducible glycolysis (PFKFB3) by PFK158 abolished the inflammatory signature and reduced TEM by 75%. These findings were substantianted using a large Atherosclerotic Endarterectomy Biobank (Athero-Express). Conclusions This data is the first that shows that Lp(a) activates the endothelium by enhancing inducible-glycolysis, leading to induction of a pro-adhesive state which can be reversed by specific inhibition of inducible-glycolysis. This novel finding paves the way for therapeutic agents targeting metabolic reprogramming to reduce the pro-inflammatory state in cardiovascular-patients.", "session_id": "3029db6e-cb92-4dd3-8b4e-e9de4a5e777e", "order": 111}

Increased BAT activity inversely correlates with NAFLD progression and since BA exert anti-inflammatory properties, we aim to investigate the role of Cyp7b1 derived-metabolites during NAFLD to NASH progression. Methods Methods :   Cyp7b1 -/-  and wild type (WT) mice fed a choline-deficient high-fat diet for 8 months (diet-induced NASH model) were housed either at 30°C (thermoneutral conditions, control) or at 22°C (mild-cold exposure) to stimulate BAT and the hepatic  Cyp7b1  overexpression. Metabolic parameters, histology, gene expression and protein levels were analyzed. BA/oxysterol species were determined by LC-MS/MS-based methods. Results Results :   Prolonged mild-cold exposure induced  Cyp7b1  expression in WT mice and attenuated NASH development compared to 30 o C in both genotypes (decreased plasma lipids, ALT activity, hepatic inflammation / fibrosis). Conversely,  Cyp7b1 -/-  mice housed at thermoneutrality have an aggravated NASH phenotype compared to controls (elevated ALT activity, hepatic fibrosis, inflammatory / fibrotic gene markers, hyperlipidemia and hyperinsulinemia). Interestingly, mild cold exposure increased hepatic  Cyp27a1 ,  Ldlr  and  Lrp1  expression of  Cyp7b1 -/-  mice, accompanied by ameliorated disease phenotype. Conclusions Conclusion :   Deletion of  Cyp7b1  augments the disease’s phenotype at 30 o C, suggesting that the downstream metabolites exert beneficial features during NASH manifestation at thermoneutral conditions. Upon mild cold exposure and BAT activation, the compensatory hepatic upregulation of  Cyp27a1  in the  Cyp7b1 -/-  mice together with this of  Ldlr  and  Lrp1  indicate an enhanced lipoprotein metabolism and could, in part, explain the improved disease state.", "session_id": "6bfcd4c8-3666-40b5-a803-1ca79d461268", "order": 114}

Desmosterol is an endogenous liver X receptor ligand with anti-inflammatory properties and reduces cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis. We aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of DHCR24 inhibition by using the novel selective DHCR24 inhibitor SH42 on hepatic steatosis and inflammation, the two most important hallmarks of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Methods Male  APOE*3-Leiden.CETP  mice, a well-established translational model for lipoprotein metabolism that develops diet-induced human-like NASH characteristics, were fed a high fat and high cholesterol diet with or without simultaneous SH42 treatment (3x0.5mg/week, i.p.). After 8 weeks, liver steatosis and inflammation were assessed. Lipidomics and lipid mediator analyses were carried out on plasma and liver. Results DHCR24 inhibition via SH42 markedly increased plasma desmosterol levels (+5,600%), without influencing food intake and body weight. SH42 decreased plasma cholesteryl ester (-24%) and fatty acids (-19%) levels whilst not affecting diacylglycerol(DAG) and triacylglycerol(TAG) levels. Notably, SH42 largely increased plasma 19,20-epoxydocosapentaenoic acid levels (+210%), a well described and potent anti-inflammatory/pro-resolving lipid mediator. In the liver, SH42 reduced DAG (-21%), TAG (-38%) and cholesteryl esters (-26%). Strikingly, liver histological assessment showed that SH42 abolished diet-induced hepatic steatosis, inflammation, ballooning and crown-like structure formation. Conclusions Inhibition of DHCR24 by SH42 abolishes hepatic steatosis, inflammation and damage as induced by a diet containing high fat and high cholesterol. DHCR24 inhibition is a potential novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of NASH by killing two birds with one stone, i.e. hepatic steatosis and inflammation.", "session_id": "6bfcd4c8-3666-40b5-a803-1ca79d461268", "order": 115}

Experimental models engineered to amplify the signaling of endogenous S1P over its specific receptors may help in clarifying this issue. To this purpose, we generated a mouse model overexpressing S1P receptor type 1 (S1P 1 ) specifically in the myeloid compartment and studied the effect on atherosclerosis development. Methods Mice overexpressing S1P 1  in myeloid cells (monocytes and macrophages) were generated by crossing mice expressing the murine S1P 1  gene under a promoter containing a floxed blocking element with mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of lysozyme (LysM Cre ) promoter. Bone marrows from these or control mice were transplanted into low density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R)-deficient mice and resulting chimeras were fed a Western diet for 14 weeks. Results S1P 1  overexpressing macrophages showed increased expression and activity of transcription factors PU.1, IRF8 and LXR. This skewed macrophages towards an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype with enhanced production of IL-10, IL-1RA and IL-5. In addition, S1P 1  overexpressing macrophages showed increased ABCA1- and ABCG1-dependent cholesterol efflux, accelerated reversed cholesterol transport, enhanced expression of MerTK and Axl1 and efferocytosis, and reduced endoplasmic stress-induced apoptosis. Atherosclerotic lesion formation in aortic roots and brachiocephalic arteries as well as necrotic core formation were significantly reduced in mice overexpressing S1P 1  in myeloid cells. Conclusions S1P 1  signaling produces a unique anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic macrophage phenotype and countervails the development of atherosclerotic lesions in mice.", "session_id": "6bfcd4c8-3666-40b5-a803-1ca79d461268", "order": 116}

We explored BemA effects in the early stage of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in a diet-induced rat model of hepatic steatosis. Methods Eight-week-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly distributed into 3 groups (n=8): control (CT; standard rodent chow), fructose plus high fat diet (FHFD; high fat diet and 10% w/v fructose in drinking water), and FHFD plus BemA at 30 mg/Kg/day (BemA). All rats were fed the diets for three months, and BemA group was treated orally with BemA for the last month. Biochemical and zoometric parameters were determined. Beta-oxidation activity and gene/protein expression were determined in hepatic tissue. Results FHFD rats consumed almost twice more calories than controls, but their body weight at the end of treatment was not increased. Significant hepatic triglyceride accumulation and hypertriglyceridemia were observed in FHFD rats. Treatment with BemA reduced hepatic triglyceride accumulation and increased liver weight in comparison to FHFD. Histological images showed an increase of hepatocyte size in Bem A group in comparison to the other groups. Beta-oxidation activity was reduced in FHFD group, and treatment with BemA not only blunted this effect, but also caused a significant increase of this enzyme activity in relation to FHFD. Accordingly, BemA markedly induced the hepatic gene expression of acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO), without changes in carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1). Conclusions BemA may induce hepatic peroxisomal proliferation and reduce hepatic steatosis at least in part through increased fatty acid catabolism.", "session_id": "6bfcd4c8-3666-40b5-a803-1ca79d461268", "order": 117}

Methods FHSC comprises regional/national data from multiple cohorts/registries/databases of individuals with a clinical and/or genetic diagnosis of FH. After ensuring data quality, we used smart, bespoke IT routines for automated data cleaning, to allow harmonisation into a merged dataset for analyses. We conducted cross-sectional analyses at registry entry, to compare the baseline characteristics of adults (age ≥18 years) with HeFH stratified by gender. Results We included 16,890 (45.8%) men and 19,945 (54.2%) women with HeFH.

Complications of defective or excessive healing are common, resulting in increased morbidity and repeated interventions. Experimental intimal hyperplasia models are vital for understanding vascular healing mechanisms and resolving clinical problems of restenosis, vein graft stenosis and dialysis access failure. Our aim was to systematically investigate the transcriptional, histological and systemic reaction to vascular injury over a prolonged period of time. Methods Balloon injury of the left common carotid artery was performed in male rats. Animals (n=69) were euthanized prior to or post-injury, either directly or after 2h, 20h, 2 days, 5 days and 2, 6, 12 weeks. Injured and contralateral arteries were microarray profiled, followed by bioinformatic exploration, histological biopsy characterization and plasma lipid analyses. Results Immune activation and coagulation were key mechanisms in the early response, followed by cytokine release, tissue remodeling and smooth muscle cell (SMC) modulation several days after injury, with re-acquisition of contractile features in later phases. Clonal expansion, inflammatory transformation and chondro-osteogenic differentiation were novel pathways identified and immunolocalized to neointimal SMCs. Analysis of uninjured arteries revealed a systemic component of the reaction following local injury, underlined by altered endothelial signaling, changes in tissue bioenergy metabolism and plasma HDL levels. Conclusions We demonstrate that vascular injury induces dynamic transcriptional landscape and metabolic changes identifiable as early, intermediate and late- response phases, reaching homeostasis after several weeks.

Cell RNA-Seq and bioinformatics analysis provided gene modulation by direct comparison of shear stress conditions and Gene Ontology of biological processes shared by the two cell types. Results A significant (> 3-fold) upregulation of MEOX2, related to proliferation and inflammation, in HCAECs, and of SEMA3E, with a role in migration and proliferation, in HCASMCs, is evidenced by low shear stress, with and without BVS. HCASMCs and HCAECs share four biological processes, two specifics for HCASMCs and two for HCAECs: three genes are constantly upregulated by low shear stress, BMP4 (neointima formation), HMOX1 (inflammation, proliferation, thrombosis) and SELE (lymphocytes homing in inflammation).

Vascular microcalcification as detected by fluorine-18-sodium fluoride ( 18 F-NaF) has recently been recognized as a valuable indicator in predicting of atherosclerotic plaque rupture and AAA expansion. However, whether vascular microcalcification is involved in the pathogenesis of AAA remains elusive. Methods Microcalcification was analyzed in human aneurysmal aortas histologically and in angiotensin II (AngII)-infused ApoE -/-  mouse aortas by  18 F-NaF PET-CT scanning in chronological order in live animals.  Results AAA patients' aortic tissue showed markedly enhanced microcalcification in the aortic media within the area proximal to elastic fiber degradation, compared to non-AAA patients. Enhanced  18 F-NaF uptake preceded significant aortic expansion in mice. Microcalcification-positive mice on day 7 of AngII infusion showed dramatic aortic expansion on subsequent days 14 to 28, whereas microcalcification-negative AngII-infused mice and saline-induced mice did not develop AAA. The application of hydroxyapatite, the main component of microcalcification, aggravated AngII-induced AAA formation  in vivo . RNA-sequencing analysis of the suprarenal aortas of 4-day-AngII-infused ApoE -/-  mice and bioinformatics analysis with ChIP-Atlas database identified the potential involvement of the osteogenic transcriptional factor Runx2 in AAA. Consistently, VSMC-specific Runx2-deficiency markedly repressed AngII–induced AAA formation in the ApoE -/-  mice compared to the control littermates. Conclusions Our studies have revealed microcalcification as a novel pathological characteristic and potential mediator of AAA, and targeting microcalcification may represent a promising strategy for AAA prevention and treatment.", "session_id": "570bb9a9-1585-4b40-ba8c-bf723bbfdf3d", "order": 135}

The phenotypical distinction between monogenic (due to causative mutations in major  LDLR ,  APOB  or  PCSK9  genes) and polygenic FH is not completely clarified.   Aims : We aimed to compare the clinical phenotype and response to treatment in monogenic  vs . polygenic FH Methods Methods:  Five hundred patients with clinical FH diagnosed based upon DLCNC> 3 were genotyped. Causative monogenic variants were identified by NGS and the polygenic score (GRS) was estimated by the 6-LDL-rising SNPs panel. Patients’ clinical characteristic and LDL-C changes during cholesterol-lowering treatments were retrospectively obtained. Results Results:  323 (64.6%) patients were FH-mutation positive (monogenic FH) and 177 (35.4%) patients were classified as FH-mutation negative (FH/M-) .  In comparison with normocholesterolemic subjects, FH/M- patients had higher mean GRS (0.71± 0.19 and 0.61±0.20, p<0.001). Based on a GRS value above 0.69 (the best cut-off discriminating FH/M– and normocholesterolemic individuals), 21% of clinically diagnosed FH were classified as polygenic. Polygenic FH were older and showed lower untreated total and LDL-C as compared to monogenic FH. During about 33 months of follow-up, monogenic FH showed higher on-treatment, last visit and best LDL-C as compared with FH/M- patients (P<0.005). These differences persisted even after adjustment for intensity of cholesterol-lowering therapies. Conclusions Conclusions:  Our results highlight that a polygenic GRS might explain the elevation of LDL-C observed in FH/M- patients. In these patients, the burden of LDL-C is lower than that in monogenic FH patients.", "session_id": "03276477-e5e0-4248-8a57-b6f9439e3f08", "order": 143}

Although modern drugs allow to reach treatment targets in most patients, for a subgroup of patients (patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia, patients with persistent dislipidaemia due to either drug resistance or intolerance, and patients with severely elevated Lp(a)) regular lipoprotein apheresis is the only option to improve cardiovascular outcome. Methods Between 1987 and 2018 our apheresis center at the University of Munich has conducted a total of 44,236 lipoprotein apheresis sessions, corresponding to a mean of 1,340 sessions per year in a total of 140 patients. Results On average each apheresis treatment decreases LDL-c and Lp(a) levels by 60-67% in a representative sample.  The procedure is generally well-tolerated, with hypotension due to volume depletion being the most common side effect. Out of 140 patients, 21 patients (15%) died, whereas 70 patients (50%) stopped treatment due to a variety of other reasons, i.e. change of place of residence (25.7%), introduction of more potent drugs (newer statins, PCSK9-inhibitors) and thus rendering apheresis redundant  (12.9%) , senescence (2.1%) and other causes (7.9%). Only 2 patients (1.4%) stopped apheresis because of intolerance. 56 patients are currently treated in our center, 4 of them have been treated for more than 30 years.  Conclusions In our experience, treatment success is associated with a number of factors such as experience (high quantity of procedures) and the engagement of a consistent medical staff, resulting in an elaborate expert knowledge of both, applied techniques and individual patient characteristics.", "session_id": "03276477-e5e0-4248-8a57-b6f9439e3f08", "order": 144}

Corresponding specific mimetic peptides were shown to reverse anti-apoA-1 IgG pro-inflammatory effects  in vitro . We evaluated the association of IgG against c-terminus apoA-1 (anti-cterA1 IgGs) with all-cause mortality in the community and tested the ability of two cterA1 mimetic peptides to reverse the anti-apoA-1 IgG-induced inflammation  in vitro  and mortality in ApoE -/- mice. Methods Anti-cterA1 IgGs were measured on serum samples of 5220 consecutive participants included in the CoLaus study with median follow-up duration of 5.6 years. The primary study outcome was all-cause mortality. Two chemically engineered optimized cterA1 mimetic peptides were tested i) on  HEK cells to modulate  interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis-alpha (TNF-α) production,   and ii) in apoE -/- mice exposed to 16 weeks of anti-apoA-1 IgG passive immunisation. Results Anti-cterA1 IgG independently predicted all-cause mortality, each standard deviation of anti-cterA1 IgG being associated with a 18% increase in mortality risk (Hazard Ratio:1.18, 95%confidence intervals:1.04-1.33;p=0.009). Both cterA1 mimetic peptides reduced the anti-apoA-1 IgG-induced inflammation in a dose-dependent manner  in vitro , but did not rescue the anti-apoA-1 IgG-associated mortality in mice. Conclusions Anti-cterA1 IgG independently predict all-cause mortality in the general population.

Patients were grouped by Lp(a) levels (nmol/L) into very Low <10; Low 10-30; Intermediate 30-120; High>120, and prevalence of vascular complications were compared between the groups. Lp(a) plasma levels in patients with good (HbA1c <52 mmol/mol) or poor (HbA1c >52 mmol/mol) metabolic control were studied. Results The patients (n=1860) had a median age 48 years, diabetes duration 25 years, and HbA1c 61 mmol/mol. The median Lp(a) (interquartile range) was 19 (10-71) nmol/L. No significant differences between males and females were observed, but Lp(a) levels increased with increasing age. Patients in the high Lp(a) group had higher prevalence of complications than patients in the very low Lp(a) group.

However, its role in atherogenesis remains elusive. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the therapeutic effects of FGF21 on atherosclerosis and the underlying mechanisms in APOE*3-Leiden.CETP mice, a well-established model for human-like lipoprotein metabolism. Methods Female APOE*3-Leiden.CETP mice were fed a cholesterol-rich Western-type diet for 3 weeks, and subcutaneously injected with either vehicle or FGF21 (1 mg/kg body weight) 3 times per week for 16 weeks. At the end of the study, kinetic studies were performed and atherosclerotic lesion area, severity and composition were assessed in the aortic root. Results FGF21 treatment reduced fat mass as explained by highly increased energy expenditure. Mechanistically, FGF21 promoted brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation and white adipose tissue (WAT) browning, thereby enhancing selective uptake of fatty acids from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins into BAT and into beige adipocytes in WAT, consequently accelerating the hepatic clearance of the cholesterol-enriched remnants as evidenced from kinetic studies with radiolabeled lipoprotein-like particles. Accordingly, FGF21 reduced plasma total cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol levels resulting in largely decreased atherosclerotic lesion area and severity. Moreover, FGF21 increased atherosclerotic plaque stability as indicated by reduced macrophage content  vs  collagen and smooth muscle cell content. Conclusions FGF21 activates BAT and induces browning of WAT, thereby accelerating lipoprotein turnover, improving hypercholesterolemia and protecting against atherosclerosis. We have thus provided mechanistic evidence to support the clinical use of FGF21 in the treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.", "session_id": "b31e04ea-5c7f-4578-9354-c8c8d2b527b2", "order": 179}

Lipid uptake into BAT does not only involve lipoprotein lipase(LPL)-mediated hydrolysis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins(TRL), but also includes whole particle uptake by endothelial cells. The relevance of endothelial TRL uptake and subsequent lysosomal processing for BAT function is still unknown. We investigated the impact of impaired lipoprotein handling in endothelial-specific lysosomal acid lipase(LAL)-deficient mice with regard to BAT biology and thermogenesis.  Methods Tamoxifen-inducible endothelial-specific LAL knockout(Lipa -/- Cdh5 cre ) mice were fed Western-type diet(WTD) and exposed to cold. Cell type-specific analyses were performed using Magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS). Gene and protein expression in WAT and BAT, indirect calorimetry and metabolic turnover studies were conducted to examine thermogenic adipose function.  Results MACS confirmed the specific LAL knockout in endothelial cells. Lipid uptake studies using radiotracer revealed an accumulation of triolein and cholesterol in LAL-deficient endothelial cells indicating delayed lipid processing.  In vivo , Lipa -/- Cdh5 cre  mice showed only minor differences in lipid uptake into BAT and beta3-adrenergic induced thermogenesis, which might be due to the compensatory induction of UCP1 and LPL. Cold exposure lead to impaired thermogenic capacity accompanied by diminished browning of white adipose tissue (WAT), in WTD, but not chow-fed mice. While BAT appearance is unaltered, LAL activity is essential for differentiation of beige adipocytes in WAT depots. Conclusions These data show the relevance of endothelial lipoprotein handling in thermogenic adipose tissues. Lysosomal lipoprotein processing is crucial for proper cold adaptation, since endothelial-specific deletion of LAL leads to impaired browning of WAT.", "session_id": "b31e04ea-5c7f-4578-9354-c8c8d2b527b2", "order": 180}

Targeting ANGPTL3 has emerged as a new therapeutic opportunity to lower two causal risk factors (LDL-C and TG) for coronary heart disease (CHD) with potentially favorable metabolic effects. It is unknown, however, if inhibiting ANGPTL3 will result in adverse consequences. The aim of this study was to evaluate if genetic loss of ANGPTL3 leads to hepatic fat accumulation. Methods We studied individuals carrying LOF mutations in  ANGPTL3  resulting in complete (N=6) or partial (N=28) ANGPTL3 deficiency along with 76 wild-type controls. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and chemical shift magnetic resonance imaging (csMRI) were used to quantify hepatic triglyceride content in ANGPTL3 LOF carriers and non-carriers. Results The mean hepatic fat fraction (HFF) measured by MRS was not significantly different in  ANGPTL3  LOF mutation carriers as compared with non-carrier controls [8.1%±13.3% (IQR 0.1%-9.2%) vs. 11.9%±16.3% (IQR 0.1%-21.6%), respectively, P=NS]. Similar results were found by csMRI [5.6%±3.8% (IQR 2.6%-7.1%) vs. 7.3%±6.2% (IQR 2.7%-9.7%), respectively, P=NS]. In a multivariate model including  ANGPTL3  genotype, age, gender, triglycerides, BMI and HOMA-IR, we found that only BMI and HOMA-IR were independently associated with increased HFF. Conclusions Unlike other genetic causes of hypolipidemia, ANGPTL3 deficiency does not appear to cause hepatic fat accumulation. This suggests that pharmacological inhibition of ANGPTL3 may not be associated with an increased risk of fatty liver disease.", "session_id": "b31e04ea-5c7f-4578-9354-c8c8d2b527b2", "order": 181}

Delayed postprandial clearance of TRLs is associated with atherosclerosis. Measurement of the effective tissue LPL activity has proven difficult, as not only the intrinsic activity of the enzyme but also the intravascular localization is important for proper TRL processing. We developed an ultrafast confocal in vivo microscopy-based approach for visualizing LPL action in capillaries. Methods The method is based on increased fluorescence resulting from LPL-mediated liberation of resorufin from recombinant TRLs containing resorufin-oleate (R-TRL). R-TRL can be used for determining LPL activity in vitro, and for visualizing LPL action in vivo by intravital confocal microscopy. Results Enzymatic activity determined by the R-TRL method could be inhibited by the lipase inhibitor tetrahydrolipstatin. It was elevated in brown adipose tissue lysates of cold-exposed vs warm-housed mice, demonstrating specificity of the assay for LPL. To map the exact anatomical site of LPL activity in BAT, we injected R-TRL intravenously and performed intravital microscopy. The association of R-TRL with capillaries and the release of resorufin were profoundly increased in cold-exposed vs. control mice, and diminished in aLKO vs. WT mice. LPL action in cold-activated BAT was found to be a discontinuous process, showing pronounced fluctuation over time. The flucuations could be prevented by the vasodilator acepromazin. Conclusions We developed a novel specific method for determining LPL activity in vitro and visualizing LPL action in an ultrafast manner.

We investigated how SIRT6 expression is regulated, and its role in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in atherosclerosis. Methods Human VSMCs (hVSMCs) were derived from atherosclerotic plaques or healthy aortas .  Lentiviruses were used to stably knockdown SIRT6 using shRNA, or overexpress SIRT6 or its deacetylase-inactive mutant (SIRT6 H133Y ). ApoE -/-  mice were generated that overexpress SIRT6 or SIRT6 H133Y  in VSMCs only. Results Human plaque VSMCs showed reduced SIRT6 protein, but not mRNA, expression compared to aortic VSMCs, which was mimicked by treating healthy VSMCs with palmitate. SIRT6 was degraded via the proteasome, but not poly-ubiquitinated upon palmitate, while the expression of ubiquitin ligase CHIP was reduced. Silencing of CHIP further enhanced SIRT6 degradation, while CHIP overexpression promoted SIRT6 stability. Loss of SIRT6 resulted in cellular senescence, shown by reduced lifespan and increased expression of p16 ink4a  and SAβG, while SIRT6 (but not SIRT6 H133Y ) overexpression halted senescence, without affecting apoptosis or DNA damage. SIRT6 knockdown also altered cell metabolism, characterised by impaired fatty acid oxidation and increased glycolysis, which was prevented by overexpressing SIRT6 but not SIRT6 H133Y . Finally, SM22α-hSIRT6/ApoE -/-  mice showed reduced aortic plaque burden after 16 weeks of high fat diet compared to controls. Further analysis of plaque composition will be available at the conference. Conclusions Sirtuin 6 protein expression is decreased in human plaque VSMCs, and is positively regulated by CHIP ligase in a non-canonical fashion. SIRT6 prevents VSMC senescence and protects against atherogenesis, identifying a potential therapeutic target.", "session_id": "1afeb77e-cfb6-4743-bee6-8e17a84b83f4", "order": 186}

Even though successful autophagy promotes VSMC survival, it is unclear whether reduced autophagic flux affects mitochondrial quality control of VSMCs in atherosclerotic plaques.  Methods We generated an apolipoprotein E deficient (ApoE -/- ) mice carrying a VSMC-specific deletion of the essential autophagy gene Atg7. Results We observed that impaired VSMC autophagy promotes an unstable plaque phenotype as well as the accumulation of fragmented mitochondria with reduced bioenergetic efficiency and more oxidative stress. Furthermore, we demonstrate that disrupted autophagic flux is linked to defective mitophagy and biogenesis of mitochondria, which exacerbate the apoptosis of VSMCs and plaque vulnerability.

ECM regulates smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration and proliferation and serves as an extracellular pool of cytokines and growth factors such as TGF-β. Response Gene to Complement (RGC)-32 has been shown to stimulate the proliferation as well as migration of aortic SMC. Our goal was to explore the effect of RGC-32 on TGF-β induced differentiation of SMC and ECM production. Methods The effect of RGC-32 on ECM production and SMC differentiation was studied by silencing RGC-32 expression in human aortic SMCs (ASMC), using transfection of RGC-32 siRNA in the presence of Lipofectamine 3000. The expression of collagens I, fibronectin, myocardin, SM22 (or transgelin) and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) were determined by real-time PCR and western blot analysis. Results We investigated the role of RGC-32 in TGF-β-induced SMC differentiation markers and ECM production in ASMC. In cultured ASMC α-SMA, collagen I, fibronectin, myocardin and SM22 were significantly induced at 18 h of stimulation with TGF-β. Silencing of RGC-32 in ASMC was followed by a significant reduction in TGF-β induced expression of myocardin (p<0.001), SM22 (p<0.002), α-SMA (p<0.02), fibronectin (p<0.05) and collagen I (p<0.03). Conclusions RGC-32 modulates myocardin and other differentiation markers expression in aortic SMC indicating that RGC-32 is an important player not only in TGF-β-mediated ECM production, but also in SMC differentiation.

It is unclear whether the 15q26.1 variants modulate FES expression, and it is also unknown whether FES plays a role in atherosclerosis. Methods Included in the Results section. Results Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis showed that in human atherosclerotic plaques, cells that expressed FES were predominately monocytes/macrophages. Analyses of isogenic monocyte cell lines generated by CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-mediated genome editing showed that monocytes with an engineered 15q26.1 CAD risk genotype had reduced FES expression and increased migratory activity. Small-interfering-RNA-mediated knockdown of FES in monocytes also promoted monocyte migration. Fes-/-Apoe-/-mice fed a high fat diet developed larger atherosclerotic plaques with a greater abundance of monocytes/macrophages and more matrix metalloproteinase-9, than Apoe-/- mice. Immunohistochemical analysis of a collection of ex vivo human coronary atherosclerotic plaques showed that plaques from patients of the 15q26.1 CAD risk genotype contained greater numbers of monocytes/macrophages. Conclusions We provide compelling evidence that the CAD risk variants at the 15q26.1 locus reduced FES expression in monocytes and that FES depletion results in larger atherosclerotic plaques with more monocytes/macrophages.

We studied individuals with verified LDLR mutations from the METSIM (METabolic Syndrome In Men) cohort as well as hypercholesterolemic individuals lacking LDLR mutations from the FINRISK 2012 cohort. Up to date, we have analysed >60 patient samples. Results First, we show that our analysis of primary cells is superior to their immortalized counterparts, which display altered cellular lipid metabolism. For each patient we can quantify multiple cell populations with different LDL internalization rates under basal and stimulated conditions. We observe substantial differences in LDL internalization and LDLR surface abundance in individuals bearing identical mutations in the LDLR gene. Additionally, we demonstrate that individuals without LDLR mutations may have decreased LDL uptake. Reduced LDL uptake is often accompanied by increased cellular lipid storage, indicative of reprogrammed lipid metabolism. Conclusions Automated profiling provides novel insights into disease mechanisms for individual patients and will be of diagnostic value.", "session_id": "fe70c488-0ff5-42ba-bcb2-8b1259dbf5ac", "order": 194}

In the present study we investigated the potential role of lysosomal dysfunction and lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) in foam cell formation by SMCs and macrophages  in vitro  and  in vivo . Methods Human and mouse arterial SMCs and macrophages treated with aggregated LDL (agLDL) to generate foam cells, and foam cells isolated from apoE-deficient mice, were investigated for lysosomal cholesterol metabolism and sites of lipid storage. Cultured foam cells and human and mouse atheromas were analyzed for LAL expression. Results Following agLDL loading, confocal microscopy revealed retention of cholesteryl ester droplets within lysosomal compartments in human and mouse SMCs, while macrophages showed most lipid droplets in cytosolic compartments. Macrophage foam cells isolated from apoE -/-  mice showed higher cell granularity as determined by forward scatter on fluorescence-activated cell sorting when compared to SMC foam cells. SMC foam cells showed no defects in lysosomal acidification or proteolysis, however, LAL expression and activity was markedly reduced in SMCs compared to macrophages both in culture and in human and mouse atheromas. Conclusions Arterial SMC foam cells show a striking reduction in LAL activity and storage of lipoprotein cholesteryl esters primarily in lysosomal compartments when compared to macrophage foam cells both  in vitro  and  in vivo . This provides a likely reason for the propensity of SMCs to form the majority of atheroma foam cells, and a novel target for the prevention and regression of atherosclerosis.", "session_id": "fe70c488-0ff5-42ba-bcb2-8b1259dbf5ac", "order": 195}

Methods To test whether  Wnt5a protects against atherosclerosis , we generated SM22Cre+/Wnt5a flox/flox /LDLR-/- mice (smWnt5a-) and littermate controls SM22Cre-/Wnt5a flox/flox /LDLR-/- mice (smWnt5a+) using the Cre/lox system , and studied their vascular phenotype. Results We found that mice deleted for Wnt5a in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) developed atherosclerosis lesions when fed a cholesterol-rich diet. VSMCs accumulated cholesterol in enlarged endosome/lysosome (LELs), and lipofuscin containing vesicles. We identified Wnt5a, as a member of the nutrient/energy/stress sensor, mTORC1 scaffolding complex, which drives lysosomal function and promotes cholesterol trafficking. Treatment of VSMCs with mTORC1 inhibitors or with recombinant Wnt5a decreased activity of mTORC1 allowing endosomal exit of the cholesterol to the ER. This raised ER cholesterol and limited cholesterol accumulation. Conclusions Thus, absence of Wnt5a decoupled mTORC1 from variations in LELs sterol levels, and this resulted in accumulation of large intracellular inclusion bodies, large LELs, decreased cholesterol content in the ER, and activation of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) a master regulator of cholesterol biosynthesis. These results reveal an unexpected function of the Wnt5a pathway, and provide a conceptually new basis for future drug development to prevent cholesterol accumulation, atherosclerosis, and lysosomal storage diseases.", "session_id": "fe70c488-0ff5-42ba-bcb2-8b1259dbf5ac", "order": 196}

The monocytes expansion is causally linked to the enlargement of the atherosclerotic lesion, while NLRP3 inflammasome activation has a major role in atherogenesis progression. We aim to reveal the effect of monocytes/macrophages on NLRP3 inflammasome activation in vascular smooth cells (VSMCs) and their phenotypic switch/foam cells formation.  Methods Flow cytometry, qPCR, caspase 1 and pyroptosis assay showed the effect of oxLDL   activated monocytes on VSMCs NLRP3 inflammasome activation and phenotypic switch in a co-culture system. Immunofluorescence quantification and ELISA illustrated the NLRP3 inflammasome activation in VSMCs in aortic roots of Apoe-/- mice on normal or high cholesterol diet (HCD). Results In the presence of oxLDL activated monocytes VSMCs contractile proteins - α-SMA and SM22α and the transcription factor Oct-4 preserving VSMCs contractile phenotype were downregulated, while the expression of the macrophages markers - MAC2, F4/80 and CD68 and KLF4 promoting atherosclerotic plaque pathogenesis were upregulated in VSMCs. In parallel, oxLDL activated monocytes conditioned medium promoted VSMCs caspase 1 activation and pyroptosis, programmed cell death.  In vivo  Apoe-/- mice fed HCD exhibited in the aortic roots an increased in α-SMA cells expressing CD68 in addition to NLRP3 and Caspase 1, Apoe-/- mice derived VSMCs secreted IL-1b (Figure 1). Conclusions These results show that oxLDL activated monocytes trigger VSMCs phenotypic switch, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which in hypercholesteremia is linked to VSMCs phenotypic transformation in atherosclerosis.

In a representative subset 23 subject free from SCA and in 23 subjects with advanced SCA, a further GM analysis by whole metagenomic shotgun sequencing (WMSS) predicted cellular and metabolic pathways expressed in each bacterial strain. Results GM was correlated with CVD risk and circulating inflammatory markers. We highlighted different GM landscape in individuals with or without SCA (p=0.016). Reduction of Bacteroides and significant increase of pro-inflammatory genera Escherichia, Coriobacteriaceae and Streptococcus was observed, while reduction of anti-inflammatory Roseburia, Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium in subjects with SCA was outlined.   WMSS added higher abundance of further pro-inflammatory Dorea, Granulicatella, Klebsiella and Citrobacter strains associated to advanced SCA. The functional metagenomic data analysis revealed specific metabolic pathways upregulated with SCA (metabolism of sugars and arginine on top) and those with absence of SCA (purines synthesis and starch degradation).

Methods In this multicenter study, we consecutively enrolled 4,355 patients from October 2011 to March 2017. Patients were categorized according to status of glucose metabolism (diabetes mellitus [DM], pre-DM, normal glucose regulation [NGR]) levels and further classified into 9 groups by RC levels.

A third of all dementia may be preventable due to vascular risk factors. Intensive multi-domain intervention trials targeting primarily vascular risk factors show improved cognitive function in people at risk. Such interventions will however be expensive to implement generally and will represent unrealistic economic tasks for most societies. Therefore, a risk score identifying high-risk individuals is warranted. Methods In 61,664 individuals from two prospective cohorts of the Danish general population, w e generated 10-year absolute risk scores for all-cause dementia and Alzheimer’s disease from genetics and vascular risk factors, to enable identification of high-risk individuals who are anticipated to benefit the most from targeted, preventive intervention.

In this study, we compared a protein-based risk model with a model using traditional risk factors in predicting CV-events in the primary prevention setting of the EPIC-Norfolk study, followed by validation in the PLIC cohort. Methods 368 proteins were measured in a nested case-control sample of 822 individuals from the EPIC-Norfolk prospective cohort study and 702 individuals from the PLIC cohort. Using tree-based ensemble and boosting methods, we constructed a protein-based prediction model, an optimized clinical risk algorithm and a model combining both.

MACE was defined as myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular death within three years after CEA. Three plasma subfractions of EVs (HDL-, LDL- and TEX-fraction) were isolated from preoperative blood samples and levels of CC, SG1, SF2 and CD14 were measured by Luminex. Cox-proportional hazard regression modelling was performed for univariate analysis. Backward stepwise regression modelling was performed to develop the best model of combined markers.

The present data has the potential to form the scientific basis for well-defined age- and sex-dependent reference intervals, improving clinical decision making within thrombosis and hemostasis.", "session_id": "32911bc3-8619-48e9-b6c3-59ecbe1a8822", "order": 211}
