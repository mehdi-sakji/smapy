Here, we analyzed the effect of plasma Lp(a) levels on caspase-1 and the pro-inflammatory cytokines it processes. We further directly compare the molecular composition of Lp(a) and LDL isolated from the same donors as well as their pro-atherogenic and pro-inflammatory potential. Methods Human plasmas with varying Lp(a) levels and isolated Lp(a) and LDL were incubated with THP-1 macrophages for three hours and caspase-1 activation and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-1\u03b1, and IL-18 was measured. Molecular composition of Lp(a) and LDL isolated from the same donors was determined by lipidomics and proteomics approaches. Results Plasma Lp(a) levels ranging from 1.7 to 165.3 mg/dL correlated significantly with caspase-1 activity (r = 0.496), IL-18 (r = 0.496), and IL-1\u03b1 (r = 0.447) in macrophages. IL-1\u03b2 secretion correlated significantly with plasma triglycerides, and not with Lp(a) levels.   Lipidomics comparison of LDL and Lp(a) indicated that Lp(a) was significantly depleted of poly-unsaturated fatty acids in all lipid classes. Proteomics analyses revealed that Lp(a) is enriched in inflammation-associated proteins. Lp(a) from induced robust and dose-dependent caspase-1 activation and release of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 compared to a mild induction upon incubation with LDL from the same donors. Conclusions Our data show that plasma Lp(a) levels directly correlate with inflammasome activation in macrophages, isolated Lp(a) induces stronger dose-dependent caspase-1 activation than LDL, and LDL and Lp(a) have clear structural differences additionally to apo(a)."},

While previous studies have shown the atherogenicity of Lp(a) on monocyte activation and migration as well by activation of the vessel wall, the atherosclerotic plaque phenotype of individuals with elevated Lp(a) levels have not been studied up till now. Methods Therefore, we measured Lp(a) levels in 1506 subjects of the Athero-Express Biobank located at the University Medical Centre Utrecht, The Netherlands. Athero-Express started in 2002 and is a prospective ongoing biobank study that includes all patients undergoing carotid or iliofemoral endarterectomy in two referral hospitals in the Netherlands. From these 1506 subjects we compared the plaques from patients with extremely high (>195 mg/dl; N=57) and low (<7 mg/dl; N=106) Lp(a) levels. Results Analysis showed that plaques from patients with elevated Lp(a) levels demonstrated a 33% increase in blood vessel area per plaque, indicating an increased plaque angiogenesis. Intraplaque neovascularization has been shown to drive the progression of atherosclerosis and enhance plaque instability leading to increased cardiovascular risk. Conclusions So far, we have shown that human arterial endothelial cells stimulated with Lp(a) show enhanced collagen degradation capacity, probably due to increased migratory capacity and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity. By using whole plaque RNA sequencing, combined with immunohistochemistry and ex-vivo validation studies (data available at the EAS 2021), we aim to further characterise the plaque phenotype in patients with elevated levels of Lp(a) and thereby provide more insight in the atherogenic potential of Lp(a)."},

Methods From the Copenhagen General Population study, we included 12,006 individuals who underwent cardiac computed tomography to measure mitral and aortic valve calcification. Participants had information on plasma lipoprotein(a),  LPA  kringle IV type 2 number of repeats; and two single nucleotide polymorphisms ( LPA  rs10455872 and rs3798220); genetic instruments known to be associated with plasma lipoprotein(a). These instruments were used to investigate the genetic association of lipoprotein(a) with mitral and aortic valve calcification to indicate causality. Results At age 70-79, 29% and 54% had mitral and aortic valve calcification. For 10-fold higher lipoprotein(a) levels, multifactorially adjusted odds ratios for mitral and aortic valve calcification were 1.26 (95% CI: 1.13-1.41) and 1.65 (1.50-1.81). Correspondingly, for \u226423 versus \u226536 kringle IV type 2 number of repeats the age and sex adjusted odds ratios for mitral and aortic valve calcification were 1.53 (1.18-1.99) and 2.23 (1.81-2.76). For carriers versus non-carriers of  LPA   rs10455872, odds ratios for mitral and aortic valve calcification were 1.33 (1.13-1.57) and 1.86 (1.64-2.13). For aortic valve stenosis, 20% (95% CI: 12%-28%) of the effect of lipoprotein(a) was mediated through calcification. Conclusions Elevated lipoprotein(a) was causally from human genetics and observationally associated with both mitral and aortic valve calcification. Aortic valve calcification mediated 20% of the effect of elevated lipoprotein(a) on aortic valve stenosis."},

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is an independent risk factor of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD) and calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS).   To assess the role of Lp(a) as well as autoantibodies to Lp(a) in CAVS in patients with and without ASCVD. Methods The study included 250 patients (mean age 69\u00b13, males 42%) that were divided into 3 groups. There were 2 groups of patients with CAVS depending on presence (group 1) or absence of ASCVD (group 2). Control group included the patients without ASCVD or CAVS. Lipids, Lp(a), autoantibodies to Lp(a) and Cu 2+ oxidized Lp(a) [autoAbs to oxLp(a)] were measured in serum for all the patients.

Lp(a) concentration in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (heFH) is not well established. Whether the genetic defect responsible for heFH plays a role in determining Lp(a) concentration is unknown.   Aims: To study Lp(a) concentration in subjects genetically diagnosed with heFH and to assess the influence of the genetic defect responsible for heFH on its concentration. Methods Methods:  Cross-sectional study, performed in a lipid clinic in Spain. We studied 511 heFH adults according to the responsible gene ( LDLR ,  APOB, APOE  and  PCSK9 ).   We selected 443 subjects  LDLR , 27 subjects  APOB , 37 subjects carriers of the p.(Leu167del) mutation in  APOE , and 4 subjects  PCSK9 . Results Results:    Lipid levels differed across gene groups after adjusting for age, sex, and BMI.Lp(a) concentration differed among subjects with  LDLR ,  APOB,  and  APOE  mutation(p <0.001).Median Lp(a) concentration was greatest in  APOB -dependent FH 36.5 mg/dL(IQR 22.0,60.8),intermediate in  LDLR -dependent FH,21.7 mg/dL (IQR 17.9, 26.4)(and independent on the affected LDL receptor protein domain) and lowest in carriers of the p.(Leu167del) mutation in  APOE,  7.9 mg/dL (IQR 4.9,12.7).Lp(a) geometric means, adjusted for age, sex, and BMI differed significantly .  The geometric mean of LPA KIV-2 repeats did not differ among the FH gene subgroups and the estimations and differences for Lp(a) remained unchanged after adjustment for the number of KIV-2 repeats. Conclusions Conclusions:    The concentration of Lp(a) in heFH  is depending on the responsible gene. Lp(a) concentration was gratest in  APOB-  dependent FH. In  LDLR -dependent, FH Lp(a) levels are not different depending on the affected protein domain."},

Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) -dependent mitochondrial deacetylase. The present study tested whether endothelial-selective Sirt3 deletion accelerates vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis and the potential effect of L-arginine to alleviate vascular inflammation associated with SIRT3 deletion. Methods Cdh5-Cre driven deletion of Sirt3-floxed allele was used to generate endothelium-specific Sirt3 knockout mice. Mice were injected with adeno-associated virus to overexpress PCSK9, and fed with high cholesterol diet to induce atherosclerosis. Human endothelial cell HUVECs and mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells were used for in vitro experiments. Results SIRT3 knockout further reduced endothelium-dependent vasodilatation impaired IL-1\u03b2 in aorta, accompanied by increased production of mitochondrial superoxide. Such effect could be attenuated by treatment with NAD or L-arginine. Deletion of SIRT3 exacerbated atherosclerotic plaque formation in mice, accompanied by higher expression of E-selectin and more macrophage infiltration, with reduced vasodilatation. In human and mouse endothelial cells, SIRT3 knockdown enhanced upregulation of vascular inflammation markers including VCAM1, ICAM1, and CCL2 induced by IL1\u03b2 or TNF\u03b1. Pre-treatment with NAD or L-arginine attenuated the upregulation of these adhesion molecules and chemokines. L-arginine also alleviated impaired mitochondrial respiration induced by TNF\u03b1 in wild type and SIRT3 knockdown endothelial cells. Conclusions Our results support the role of mitochondrial SIRT3 against atherosclerotic inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Further study is needed to identify the enzymes in L-arginine metabolism regulated by SIRT3 in endothelial cells (supported by RGC/GRF 14109519)."},

Our previous findings that prenylcysteine oxidase 1 (PCYOX1) represents a novel lipoprotein-associated protein, and that lipoproteins can themselves generate the reactive oxygen species H 2 O 2  through the action of PCYOX1, prompted us to investigate the biological role of this unique enzyme in the development of atherosclerosis. Methods Gene silencing approaches with proteomic and biochemical analysis have been introduced to study PCYOX1 biological functions.  In vivo  localization of PCYOX1 has been performed in human atherosclerotic lesions and aortic arch of ApoE -/-  mice. A double knockout mouse model (PCYOX1 \u2212/\u2212 /apoE \u2212/\u2212  mice) was treated with Western-type diet in order to study atherosclerotic lesion progression and the inflammatory status. Results Here, we provided evidence that the pro-oxidant enzyme Prenylcysteine Oxidase 1 (PCYOX1), in the human atherosclerotic lesions, is both synthesized locally and transported within the subintimal space by proatherogenic lipoproteins accumulating in the arterial wall during atherogenesis. Further, PCYOX1 deficiency in apoE -/-  mice retards atheroprogression, is associated with decreased features of lesion vulnerability and lower levels of lipid peroxidation, improves plasma lipid profile, and reduces inflammation. Conclusions Collectively, these findings identify the pro-oxidant enzyme PCYOX1 as a novel player in atherogenesis and, therefore, understanding the biology and mechanisms of all functions of this unique enzyme is likely to provide significant therapeutic opportunities in addressing atherosclerosis"},

Methods Age and sex-matched male and female Grx1 -/-  and WT mice were a fed chow diet for 18 months. Body weights and fasting blood glucose levels were measured weekly, and atherosclerosis was accessed after 18 months. Myeloid Grx1 deficient mice (Grx1 Leuko -/- ) were generated by transplanting either WT or Grx1 -/-  bone marrow (BM) cells into atherosclerosis-prone male and female LDLR -/-  mice and were fed a high-calorie diet (HCD) for 20 weeks. Monocyte priming was determined by  in vivo  Matrigel plug assay. MKP-1 activity was measured to examine monocyte function. Macrophage reprogramming was determined by targeted RT-qPCR using custom-designed 384 TaqMan\u00ae Gene Expression Array Cards. Results At 18 months of age, female Grx1 -/-  mice were 30% heavier than males. Monocytes in 18-month old female Grx1 -/-  mice were primed, and promoted the recruitment of monocyte-derived macrophages into adipose tissues, and developed early atherosclerotic lesions. Grx1 deficiency promotes the reprogramming of macrophages, notable induction of genes encoding ROS and RNS generating enzymes. This reprogramming is sexually dimorphic and dramatically exacerbated in macrophages from old female mice. Female but not male Grx1 Leuko -/-  mice recapitulated the obesogenic and atherogenic phenotype of female Grx1 -/-  mice, showing accelerated weight gain (+14.6%), hyperglycemia, and accelerated atherosclerosis (+21%) compared to WT BM recipient mice. Conclusions We identified a critical and sexually dimorphic role for monocytic Grx1 activity in protecting monocytes and macrophages from HFD-induced reprogramming and dysfunction and preventing obesity and atherosclerosis."},

PLIN2 stabilizes LDs and LDs protect PLIN2 from rapid degradation. LD-bound PLIN2 degradation is dependent on AMPK-phosphorylation via chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). PLIN2 is vital to maintain certain LD size and number. We have recently shown that the Ser251Pro SNP in PLIN2 influences macroautophagy, cholesterol efflux, cholesterol accumulation and is associated with subclinical atherosclerosis development in humans. Since a direct crosstalk between macroautophagy and CMA has been proposed, we aim to investigate whether the Ser251Pro SNP affects CMA and the degradation of PLIN2, thereby influencing lipophagy. Methods We utilized stably transfected HEK293 cells carrying either variant of PLIN2 loaded with oleate, followed by treatment with AMPK modulators: we measured PLIN2 and L2A levels by WB and colocalization of Hsc70/L2A by IHC. We used WT, ATG5 -/-  and L2A -/-  MEF cells transiently transfected with PLIN2 variants: we measured LD number by IHC, PLIN2 levels by WB. Results Ser251Pro-dependent differences in lipid accumulation observed in WT MEF cells are abolished in both ATG5 -/-  and L2A -/-  MEF cells. Cells carrying the Pro251 allele show lower L2A expression and less Hsc70/L2A colocalization, indicating fewer CMA-active lysosomes. Further, AMPK inhibition in HEK cells induces PLIN2 expression more in Ser251- than in Pro251-carrying cells. Conclusions The effect of the Ser251Pro SNP on lipid accumulation is dependent on both macroautophagy and CMA. The presence of the Pro251 allele reduces CMA-activity and modifies PLIN2 degradation via AMPK. Thus, PLIN2 influences lipophagy via crosstalk between macroautophagy and CMA."},

In the present work, we appraise the cytoprotective property and anti-atherosclerosis effect of Z-Ligustilide (Z-Lig), which is derived from the Ligusticum species. Methods Potential NRF2 activators were screened and verified by luciferase reporter gene assay. The protein and mRNA levels of NRF2 and ARE-mediated genes, and GSH/GSSG level in EA.hy926 cells treated with Z-Lig were detected. The cytoprotective property of Z-Lig was assessed in the tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP)-evoked oxidative stress model. Cell viability and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in EA.hy926 cells were determined. An atherosclerosis model induced by HFD was used to determine the anti-atherosclerosis effect of Z-Lig in HFD-fed Ldlr-deficient mice. Results In vitro, 100 \u03bcM Z-Lig upregulated expressions of NRF2 and ARE-driven genes, promoted accumulation of nuclear NRF2 and unbound NRF2- KEAP1 complex in EA.hy926 cells. Furthermore, Z-Lig alleviated oxidative stress and cell injury caused by t-BHP via stimulation of the NRF2/ARE pathway. In vivo, intervention with 20 mg/kg Z-Lig markedly restrained atherosclerosis progression, including attenuation of HFD-induced atherosclerotic plaque formation, alleviation of lipid peroxidation and increase in antioxidant enzyme activity in aortas of HFD-fed Ldlr-/- mice. The chemopreventive effects of Z-Lig might be associated with the activation of NRF2 and ARE-driven genes.

Polygenic Risk Scores (PRSs) have been developed using few to millions of SNPs to identify patients with polygenic-FH. We here set up and compared the performance of several PRSs for the diagnosis of polygenic-FH. Methods Four PRSs for LDL-c were set up using PLINK, PRSice2, Lassossum and LDpred2 softwares, including 165 to 1633 SNPs sequenced using the Dysliseq panel. These PRSs were tested in 758 hypercholesterolemic patients, and 1082 French healthy controls and then compared with previously described PRSs. The fraction of LDL-c variance explained by PRSs was defined in controls and the ability of PRS to discriminate mutation negative patients (FH/M-) vs. healthy individuals was determined using ROC curves. Patients with PRSs > 95 th  percentile of controls were considered as polygenic-FH. Results The 165-SNP PRS developed with PLINK explains the highest part of LCL-c variance (adjusted R\u00b2: 0.187) and shows the best diagnosis ability (AUC: 0.759, significantly over performing previously-published PRSs: p-value < 1x10 -5 ). Within FH/M- patients, 22% of polygenic forms were detected using this 165-SNP PRS versus 14% with the previously-published 12-SNP PRS (p-value: 5.41x10 -5 ). Conclusions Notably, this new PRS improves the diagnosis ability and is compatible with routine genetic diagnosis. Indeed, the identification of polygenic-FH allows the etiologic diagnosis in FH/M- and the identification of an additional cause of hypercholesterolemia in FH/M+."},

In pathological studies, the extent and type of atherosclerosis are commonly assessed based on histological plaque characteristics that are linked to plaque rupture and erosion. A better understanding of the biology underlying variability in plaque composition will provide insights into the progression of cardiovascular diseases. We investigated the genetics of the plaque through multivariate and integrative genome-wide analyses (GWAS) of individual plaque characteristics. Methods We included carotid endarterectomy patients from the Athero-Express Biobank Study (n = 2,124) with high-density imputed data and extensive histochemical plaque phenotyping available. We used slideToolKit to quantify the number of endothelial cells, macrophages and smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and manually assessed the number of intraplaque vessels, the amount of collagen and calcification, the atheroma size, and the presence of plaque hemorrhage. We ran GWAS on all traits correcting for age, sex, array used, and genetic ancestry. Results We identified 3 loci that significantly associate with CD68+ macrophages and ACTA2+ SMCs, p < 5x10 -8 . Statistical fine-mapping revealed 9 variants in the 95% credible set and functional annotation linked these to genes associated with malignant neoplasms, circulating cholesterol, and transmembrane proteins, suggesting an effect on cellular proliferation and cholesterol metabolism. Conclusions We provide evidence for 3 loci that modulate plaque composition through macrophages and smooth muscle cell plaque proliferation and cell-cell interactions."},

However, the repetitive KIV-2 domain is difficult to analyze by conventional PCR-based technologies. The KIV-2 variant 4733G>A is a novel and frequent putative splicing modifier but its function, impact on Lp(a) and coronary artery disease (CAD) risk and, importantly, its combined effect with the 4925G>A, another frequent functional KIV-2 variant, have not been characterized. Methods We typed the 4733G>A variant in the German Chronic Kidney Disease (GCKD) study (n=4,673) using a novel allele-specific assay. Its function was analyzed by minigene assays. Ethnic frequencies were assessed in 1000Genomes. Proxy SNPs were identified in GCKD and used to analyze the effect of 4733G>A and the combined effect with 4925G>A on CAD in UK Biobank (n=440,234). Results The 4733G>A variant has a carrier frequency of 38%, lowers Lp(a) by 14.0 mg/dL ([15.3-12.6], p=4.82e-184) and was the second strongest genetic factor after the apolipoprotein(a) isoforms. It is found in all isoforms and reduces the expression of the mutated allele. Frequencies differ strongly between ethnicities. Compound heterozygous carriers of 4733G>A and 4925G>A have low Lp(a) concentrations (median=7.2 mg/dL) with little variance left (IQR=4.6 mg/dL), independently from the isoform present. 4733G>A alone and compound heterozygosity with 4925G>A are associated with a significantly lower hazard ratio for CAD (0.91 [0.89-0.93], p<0.001 and 0.88 [0.84-0.93], p<0.001). Conclusions Hidden functional  LPA  variants profoundly modulate Lp(a) concentrations and CAD risk. Furthermore, the 4733G>A variant is a novel instrument to dissect the effect of Lp(a) concentrations and apolipoprotein(a) isoforms."},

Using Mendelian randomization, we tested the hypothesis that plasma TSH concentration is associated with risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD), myocardial infarction (MI), and atrial fibrillation (AF). Methods In a prospective cohort study of the general population, The Copenhagen General Population Study, including 105,224 individuals, we first tested whether plasma TSH concentration was associated observationally with risk of incident IHD, MI, and AF (=positive control). Subsequently, we tested the genetic association between an allele score weighted on plasma TSH concentrations and risk of the same endpoints. Results During a median follow-up of 7 years (0-13 years), 5,425 developed IHD, 2,148 had an incident MI, and 5,105 developed AF. Observationally, using multifactorially adjusted restricted cubic splines, low plasma TSH concentrations (<1.53mIU/L=median) were associated with an increased risk of IHD, MI, and AF. Hazard ratios (HR) increased gradually with lower TSH concentrations up to 1.11(0.99-1.23) for IHD, 1.22(1.03-1.43) for MI, and 1.22(1.10-1.35) for AF, comparing individuals with TSH concentrations in the lowest 5 th  (\u22640.54mIU/L) versus >25 th  (>1.04mIU/L) percentile (=reference). In genetic analyses, comparing individuals with a gene score \u22645 th  percentile (who had 16% lower TSH concentrations), versus individuals with a gene score >50 th  percentile (=reference), HRs were 1.13(1.00-1.28) for IHD, 1.29(1.07-1.55) for MI, and 1.15(1.02-1.31) for AF.

Whether adiposity has a direct causal effect on the risk of CAD, or whether the effect of adiposity on CAD is mediated indirectly through the effect of adiposity on other risk factors is unknown. Methods We constructed a body mass index (BMI) instrumental variable genetic score composed of 96 variants associated with BMI. We used this instrument to conduct a multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) mediation analysis to estimate the direct and indirect effects of BMI on CAD. The study included individual level data on 445,774 participants including 23,032 cases of CAD and 28,563 cases of type II diabetes (T2D); and summary data on up to 877,643 participants including 63,746 cases of CAD and 26,676 cases of T2D. Results A one unit increase in BMI was associated with a 7% increased odds of CAD (OR:1.07; 95%CI:1.05-1.09, p=1.6E-10), a 25% increased odds of T2D (OR:1.25, 95%CI:1.23-1.28, p=2.2E-131); and 0.34 mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) (95%CI:0.25-0.42, p=8.5E-15). A one unit increase in BMI was also associated with a 0.02 mmol/L increase in triglycerides (95%CI:0.02-0.03, p=4.9E-21), but not with increased apolipoprotein B levels. In MR mediation analyses, 80.0% of the effect of BMI on the risk of CAD was mediated through BMI induced increases in SBP (29.6%) and T2D risk (50.4%). Conclusions The vast majority of the effect of increased BMI on the risk of CAD appears to be mediated indirectly through the effect of BMI on SBP and T2D."},

However, the complex heterogeneity of VSMC and how VSMC de-differentiation affects human carotid artery disease (CAD) risk has not been clearly established. The aim of the present study is to comprehensively characterized the transcriptomic profile of phenotypically modulated VSMC and to identify mediators of VSMC transition to osteogenic like cells with likely detrimental role for atherosclerosis plaque stability. Methods Single-cell RNA sequencing of CD45 negative cells derived from Apoe -/-  mice on a normal (NCD) or high cholesterol diet (HCD) was performed. To confirm the identified marker mediator of VSMC transition to osteogenic like cells, immunofluorescence staining of aortic roots of VSMC lineage tracing Apoe -/-  Myh11-CreERT2, ROSA26 STOP-flox eYFP +/+  mice fed an NCD or HCD and of internal carotid plaque specimens from symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with CAD was used. VSMC osteogenic switch was quantified upon GDF10 and oxLDL stimulation by flow cytometry. Results Disease-relevant gene signature of VSMC macrophagic calcific phenotype, VSMC mesenchymal chondrogenic phenotype, VSMC inflammatory and fibro phenotype and VSMC inflammatory phenotype was revealed. The osteoblast factor   GDF10 was highly expressed in phenotypically modified VSMC clusters, in parallel GDF10 stimulation in combination with oxLDL triggered VSMC osteogenic switch  in vitro.  Moreover, higher GDF10 expression in phenotypically modified VSMC in human atherosclerotic plaques was associated with an increased risk of plaque rupture in CAD patients. Conclusions Osteoblast factor GDF10 is associated with VSMC transition to osteogenic like cells with likely detrimental role in atherosclerosis plaque stability."},

These events, added to inflammation and thin layers of collagen unchain atherothrombosis, the main cause of Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACs). Pattern recognition receptor Nucleotide-Binding Oligomerization Domain-1 (NOD1) has previously been linked to inflammation and cardiovascular diseases. The aim of this work was to unveil the function of NOD1 in the plaque stabilization phenomena in the late stages of the disease. Methods Athero-prone  Apoe -/- Nod1 -/-  against  Apoe -/- mice were treated with high fat diet for 16 weeks in order to characterized the advanced lesions in the aortic sinus. Proliferation, apoptosis and foam cell formation were assessed in the atheroma lesions and in primary cell cultures of macrophages and vascular SMCs. In addition, human coronary arteries were employed. Cell procedures, flow cytometry, immunofluorescences, histochemistry techniques, qRT-PCR, western blot and kinetic colorimetric assays were performed. Results ORO stained aorta showed a reduction in the atheroma of the double-knockout mice. NOD1 staining in human atherosclerotic coronary arteries was enhanced near lipid deposition areas and NOD1 expression was higher in Macrophages (MAC3 marker) and SMCs (Smooth Muscle \u03b1-actin marker) of these plaques. We also demonstrated that NOD1 deletion or inhibition reduced myeloid cells infiltration, macrophage and SMCs apoptosis, fibrous caps and collagen content. Interestingly,  Nod1 -/- SMCs presented higher proliferation rates. Conclusions To conclude, here we determine that both macrophages and SMCs are subjected to NOD1 regulation under advanced atherogenesis condition, triggering plaque vulnerability and thus promoting atherothrombosis and ACS."},

These peptides trigger biological effects through the elastin receptor complex (ERC). Data from the last decade have brought significant insights on the critical role played by its catalytic subunit, Neuraminidase-1 (NEU1), in the biological effects mediated by EDP in vascular and metabolic diseases. Methods We recently developed a proteomic approach dedicated to the purification and identification of membrane NEU1-associated protein complexes in human macrophages and identified several promising candidates (Kawecki et al, CMLS. 2019). Results Here, we validated and characterized two novel interactions with NEU1 in human monocytes and endothelial cells involving the \u03b2 2  integrin and ICAM-1, respectively. We show that binding of EDP to the ERC leads to desialylation of monocyte \u03b2 2  integrin and endothelial ICAM-1 through membrane NEU1. Importantly, desialylation of either monocyte \u03b2 2  integrin or endothelial ICAM-1 by EDP is sufficient to potentiate monocyte adhesion to a monolayer of endothelial cells. Conclusions These results demonstrate, for the first time, that binding of EDP to the ERC modulates the sialylation levels of monocyte \u03b2 2  integrin and endothelial ICAM-1 through NEU1, and highlight that EDP and the ERC may be important regulators of circulating monocytes recruitment to inflamed vascular sites through this sialidase. By its ability to interact with and to modulate the sialylation of key membrane glycoproteins through NEU1, new biological functions are anticipated for EDP and the ERC in vascular diseases involving elastic fibers and elastin degradation."},

DNA damage leads to VSMC senescence and inflammation and VSMC senescence promotes atherosclerosis; however, the exact mechanism by which VSMC senescence promotes lesion formation is not known. Here, we investigated telomere damage-induced VSMC senescence, the contribution of senescence-induced inflammation and the mechanisms involved, the consequences of VSMC senescence  in vivo  after injury, and whether it promotes clonality. Methods Methods:  Stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS) was induced by doxorubicin (24h treatment+21d recovery). Lentiviruses were used to stably overexpress a dysfunctional TRF2 mutant protein (TRF2 T188A ) in hVSMCs. SM22\u03b1TRF2 T188A  mice were generated that express human TRF2 T188A  in VSMCs only, and crossed with Myh11-Cre ERT2  Rosa26-Confetti multicolour reporter mice to examine cell senescence and clonality  in vivo . Results Results:  Both SIPS and TRF2 188A -induced VSMC senescence were characterised by persistent telomere damage, and associated with formation of micronuclei, activation of cGAS-STING cytoplasmic DNA sensing, and induction of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines. Silencing of cGAS in TRF2 T188A  hVSMCs partially inhibited NF\u03baB-dependent cytokine expression.  In vivo , VSMC-specific TRF2 T188A  expression in a multicolour VSMC-tracking model demonstrated no change in VSMC clonal patches after injury, but increased neointima formation, outward remodelling, and immune/inflammatory cell infiltration or retention. Conclusions Conclusion:  Persistent telomere damage promotes VSMC senescence and inflammation and exacerbates neointima formation after injury. Our data suggest that persistent telomere damage-induced VSMC senescence plays a major role in driving inflammation through immune cell recruitment in vascular disease."},

Here we evaluated the role of LDLR on T cell biology Methods Immunophenotypic characterization of CD8T cells from WT and LDLR KO mice was performed in vitro (anti-CD3/CD28) and in vivo (vaccination, homeostatic proliferation) coupled to proteomic and confocal analysis on isolated CD8T cells. In parallel, T cells from FH were tested. Results LDLR deficiency dampened CD8+ proliferation (-35%, p<0.01) paralleled by a reduction in INF\u03b3 production (-39.6%, p<0.01). In vivo antigen-specific activation by ovalbumin vaccination, but not homeostatic proliferation, resulted in a decreased proliferation and cytokines production (\u2193IFN\u03b3 p<0.001,\u2193IL13 p<0.01,\u2193perforin p<0.05) in CD8+ of KO mice. Incubation with LDL significantly increased the proliferation in WT but not KO CD8T cells (+11%,p<0.01), a phenotype that was compensated by a reprogramming of de-novo synthesis in KO CD8T cells. Proteomic analysis revealed an impairment in glycolysis and OXPHOS associated to downregulation of pathways downstream to mTORC1 activation, possibly link to its reduced lysosomal localization observed in KO CD8T cells.   CD8+ T cells from FH subjects proliferated less (-36%, p>0.05) compared to sex- and age-matched controls and presented a decreased granzyme production (-60.3%, p<0.01) when CD8 memory response was tested in vitro with virus-derived peptides in seasonal influenza vaccinated matched controls and FH subjects. Conclusions LDLR plays a critical role in regulating the immunometabolic responses in CD8+ Tcells, and thus might represent a checkpoint linking cellular cholesterol metabolism to adaptive immune response."},

The human GPR32 receptor serves in tandem with the ALX/FPR2 receptor to transduce biological actions of pro-resolving mediators that stimulate resolution of inflammation. However, since no murine homologs of the human GPR32 exist and comprehensive  in vivo  studies are lacking, we generated a novel transgenic mouse model expressing human GPR32 while lacking Fpr2 on a hyperlipidemic background to investigate the role of GPR32  in vivo . Methods Human atherosclerotic lesions from carotid endarterectomies and normal controls were used for mRNA microarray analysis and immunofluoresence staining. A novel transgenic mouse model expressing human GPR32 on a Fpr2\u00d7apolipoprotein E double KO background (hGPR32 myc \u00d7Fpr2 -/- \u00d7ApoE -/- ) was generated. Mice were either subjected to HFD induced atherosclerosis or zymosan peritonitis, and organs collected for cellular and biochemical analysis, e.g. RT-qPCR, immunohistochemistry and fow cytometry. Results GPR32 mRNA was reduced in human atherosclerotic lesions and correlated with immune cell markers Arg1, iNOS and FoxP3. Atherosclerotic lesions and aortic inflammation were reduced in hGPR32 myc Tg\u00d7Fpr2 -/- \u00d7ApoE -/-  transgenic mice as compared to Fpr2 -/- \u00d7ApoE -/-  non-transgenic littermates. In a zymosan induced peritonitis model, the hGPR32 myc Tg\u00d7Fpr2 -/- \u00d7ApoE -/-  transgenic mice had ~55% less exudate neutrophils at 4h and enhanced pro-resolving macrophage responses at 24h. Treatment with the GPR32 agonist aspirin-triggered resolvin D1 (AT-RvD1) reduced neutrophil numbers in hGPR32 myc Tg\u00d7Fpr2 -/- \u00d7ApoE -/-  transgenic mice but not in the Fpr2 -/- \u00d7ApoE -/-  non-transgenic littermates.

Since epigenetic processes are important in controlling macrophage function, interfering with epigenetic pathways might be a novel approach to combat atherosclerosis. Histone H3K27 trimethylation is a repressive histone mark catalyzed by the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) with EZH2 as the catalytic subunit. We previously showed that myeloid deletion of  Kdm6b , an enzyme that in contrast to PRC2 removes repressive H3K27me3 marks, results in advanced atherosclerosis. Because of its opposing function, we here studied macrophage EZH2 and JARID2, both part of the PRC2 complex, in macrophage activation and atherosclerosis. Methods Myeloid-specific  Ezh2  ( Ezh 2 del ) and  Jarid2  ( Jarid2 del ) deficient mice strains were generated (LysM-Cre+ x  Ezh2 fl/fl  or  Jarid2 fl/fl ) and bone marrow from  Ezh2 del  or  Ezh2 wt  mice was transplanted to  Ldlr -/-  mice which were fed a high fat diet for 9 weeks to study atherosclerosis. Results Atherosclerotic lesion size was significantly decreased in  Ezh2 del  transplanted mice compared to control. The percentage of macrophages in the lesions was similar. However neutrophil numbers were lower in  Ezh2 del  transplanted mice. Correspondingly, the migratory capacity of neutrophils was decreased. Moreover, peritoneal  Ezh2 del  foam cells showed a reduction in the inflammatory response with reduced production of IL-6, IL-12 and NO. Currently, we are investigating the effects of JARID2 as important co-factor for the PRC2 complex on macrophage inflammatory responses by use of the  Jarid2 del  mouse strain and siRNA\u2019s against JARID2 in human macrophages. Conclusions Myeloid  Ezh2  deficiency impairs neutrophil migration and reduces macrophage foam cell inflammatory responses, both contributing to reduced atherosclerosis."},

Methods Here we investigate the role of DOT1L in macrophages by application of a selective DOT1L inhibitor on either mouse or human macrophages and using myeloid-specific  Dot1l  deleted mice. Furthermore, we investigated myeloid  Dot1l   in vivo  in a mouse model for atherosclerosis including scRNAseq on atherosclerotic plaques. Results Using RNA-seq and  in vitro  assays, we found that  Dot1l  represses macrophage activation and impacts cellular lipid metabolism. ChIP-seq for H3K79me revealed that DOT1L regulates H3K79 methylation of RXR\u03b1 in macrophages, leading to reduced RXR\u03b1 mRNA and protein expression, both upon  Dot1l  deletion as well as DOT1L inhibition. Given the established role for RXR\u03b1 in controlling macrophage activation and lipid homeostasis, the phenotype we observe can thus be at least partly explained by impaired RXR\u03b1 signaling. Moreover, we could induce a similar suppressed lipid phenotype using an RXR\u03b1 antagonist in wild-type macrophages.   In vivo , we confirmed that myeloid  Dot1l  deletion increases the activation of plaque macrophages. Moreover, although plaque area was not affected,  Dot1l  deficiency led to enhanced necrosis, indicating potential plaque destabilization. Apart from these direct effects, we found that myeloid  Dot1l  also affects other immune cell subsets illustrated by reduced production of IgG and IgM antibodies targeting atherosclerosis-related antigens. Conclusions Our data show that myeloid DOT1L is a critical regulator of macrophage inflammatory responses and lipid homeostasis and that it impacts  in vivo  immune responses and atherosclerosis development."},

The HDL receptor-deficient mouse (Scarb1 -/- ), a robust model of this phenotype, is characterized by high free cholesterol (FC) bioavailability due to too many HDL particles that are FC-rich. Clinically, plasma LDL and HDL are quantified according to their total cholesterol content, the sum of FC and esterified cholesterol, which likely contribute to ASCVD pathophysiology differently. A Western diet induces ASCVD in Scarb1 -/-  mice, despite an attendant increase in HDL, the so-called \u201cgood cholesterol.\u201d We tested the hypothesis that high HDL-FC bioavailability contributes to ASCVD in Scarb1 -/-  mice by increasing FC flux into macrophage cells and erythrocytes. Methods Methods : Influx of HDL-FC and efflux of macrophage FC were determined between WT and SCARB1 -/-  HDL and J774 macrophage cells. HDL of both genotypes were radiolabelled with [ 3 H]FC, injected into autologous mice, and the rates of plasma clearance and erythrocyte uptake were determined. Results Results : Compared to WT mice, in Scarb1 -/-  mice, autologous HDL-FC cleared faster and more HDL-FC transferred to macrophages. The FC/phospholipid ratios of HDL, LDL, erythrocytes, as well as some tissues, were higher. The high FC/phospholipid ratios of ovaries, erythrocytes, heart, and macrophages in response to the higher HDL-FC bioavailability in Scarb1 -/-  mice is associated respectively with female infertility, impaired cell maturation, cardiac dysfunction, and ASCVD. Conclusions   Conclusion : These findings provide a rationale for human studies to determine the utility of HDL-FC bioavailability as a risk factor for ASCVD and other pathologies."},

Dietary fat composition may represent an important modulator of platelet activation, but underlying mechanisms are unclear.   Aim:  To determine the effects of replacement of dietary saturated fatty acids (SFA) with unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) on platelet function in healthy men. Methods Methods:  In this secondary analysis of the RISSCI-1 study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03270527), platelet function analysis was performed in a subgroup of men (n=51) at the University of Reading. Participants followed two sequential isoenergetic diets for 4 weeks each: high-SFA (18% of total energy (TE)) and low-SFA (\u226410%TE). Light transmission platelet aggregometry and flow cytometric measurement of platelet P-selectin exposure, and fibrinogen binding were measured in response to a series of agonists at the end of each intervention diet. Platelet sensitivity to the agonists was established by calculating the EC 50 . Results Results:  Platelet sensitivity to a collagen receptor (GPVI) selective agonist was increased after the high compared with low SFA diet ( P =0.007)(P-selectin binding, EC 50 ). A significant increase in the extent of platelet aggregation and the capacity to bind fibrinogen in response to ADP were also evident after the high compared with low SFA diet ( P \u22640.025). Platelet count increased, whereas platelet size decreased in whole blood after the high than low SFA diet ( P \u22640.01).

Here, we aim to investigate the role of PCSK6 in lipid metabolism, and particularly in the context of atherosclerosis. Methods We used publically available datasets as well as biobanks to investigate the expression of PCSK6 in healthy and diseased tissues. In addition, we used Pcsk6 -/-  to investigate the effect of PCSK6 ablation. Results Genetic analyses of the PCSK6 locus identified a variant rs7181043 that was significantly associated with PCSK6 mRNA expression in healthy human adipose tissue, liver and in atherosclerotic plaques. The same variant was associated specifically with plaque fat content and atherosclerotic patient\u2019s plasma LDL levels. In addition, PCSK6 mRNA expression in plaques was positively correlated with total plasma cholesterol and LDL levels in atherosclerotic patients. Further analyses using public scRNAseq data of healthy human livers, revealed that PCSK6 is expressed in hepatocytes and stellate cells. Microarray comparison of the livers from Pcsk6 -/-  mice and wild-type controls showed that VLDL particle assembly was one of the upregulated processes, in adipose tissue we found an increase in inflammatory infiltration and regulation of T cell mediated immunity. Preliminary  in vivo  studies showed that Pcsk6 -/-  mice have higher plasma cholesterol and LPL levels at baseline compared to controls, and lower levels of LDLR in their liver. Conclusions Our data suggests that PCSK6 is involved in cholesterol and metabolic control. Further experiments are warranted in order to understand the role of PCSK6 in lipid metabolism."},

Methods Methods:  We have measured total PCSK9 plasma levels, by ELISA assay, in hypercholesterolemic patients at baseline and under treatment with mAbs anti-PCSK9.  In vitro  human hepatocarcinoma cell line (Huh7) was incubated with evolocumab or alirocumab and total PCSK9 and LDLR were determined. Results Results:  Baseline plasma levels of PCSK9 (n=26 patients) was 458.8\u00b1297.4 ng/ml and increased to 1533.3\u00b1333.5 ng/ml in response to mAbs anti-PCSK9.

We investigated PCSK9 influence on cerebral lipid metabolism and neuroinflammation in human cell models of astrocytes and neurons. Methods The following models have been utilized: 1) human astrocytoma cells (U-373) exposed to human recombinant PCSK9; 2) human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) overexpressing human PCSK9 and differentiated to neurons with retinoic acid. Results In U-373, exogenous PCSK9 reduced the expression of the LDL receptor (LDLr) and of the apoE receptor 2 (ApoER2); (-91 and -37%, respectively; p<0.05) and increased cholesterol synthesis (+44%; p<0.01), but the total cholesterol content was reduced (- 20%; p<0.05). In U373, PCSK9 did not affect plasma membrane cholesterol distribution nor efflux to isolated apoE or apoE-containing HDL. PCSK9 also worsened the inflammatory response induced by A\u03b2 fibrils, further increasing the gene expression of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 (p<0.05). In PCSK9-overexpressing SH-SY5Y, the uptake apoE-HDL-derived [ 3 H]-cholesterol was significantly reduced compared to control cells (-30%; p<0.001). PCSK9 overexpression also reduced the interaction between fluorescein labelled-apoE and cells. Moreover, the expression of the ApoER2 and of the LDLr was significantly reduced (-33% and -57%, respectively; p<0.05). PCSK9 expression was associated to a reduced cell viability in A\u03b2 fibrils-treated SH-SY5Y (-20%; p<0.05).

Prior studies suggested Lp(a) mass contains ~30% cholesterol. A high-throughput, sensitive and rapid method to quantitate Lp(a)-C and improve the accuracy of \u201cLDL-C\u201d was developed. Methods Lp(a) was isolated on magnetic beads linked to monoclonal antibody LPA4 recognizing apolipoprotein(a) and the cholesterol content measured with standard techniques. This method does not detect cholesterol in plasma samples lacking Lp(a) and is linear up to 747 nM Lp(a). LDL-C corr  was determined as LDL-C - Lp(a)-C. Results Lp(a)-C and LDL-C corr  were determined in 29 participants from a completed clinical trial of Lp(a) lowering with an antisense oligonucleotide. Baseline Lp(a) ranged from 9.0-822.8 nM, Lp(a)-C ranged from 0.6-35.0 mg/dL and correlated significantly with Lp(a) molar concentration (r=0.76, p<0.001). The percent Lp(a)-C relative to Lp(a) mass varied from 5.8\u201357.3% and was not affected by Lp(a) lowering.

Macrophage activation results in increased inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression which can be modulated by cyclooxygenase (COX) activity. As both a substrate and potential inhibitor of COX activity, the omega-3 fatty acid EPA may modulate iNOS activity. We investigated the effect of EPA and DHA on iNOS activity in LPS-activated macrophages. Methods Murine J774 macrophages were pretreated with vehicle, EPA or DHA over a range of concentrations (1.9\u00b5M-50\u00b5M) during a challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at 1.0 \u00b5g/ml in DMEM supplemented with 1% FCS. After 24 hr, iNOS activity was assessed by nitrite production using the Griess assay. As a positive control, nitrite measurements with EPA and DHA were compared in combination with the COX inhibitor diclofenac at 100 \u00b5M. Results Macrophage treatment with LPS increased nitrite levels. EPA treatment reduced LPS-induced nitrite production in a concentration-dependent manner with statistically significant reductions (Figure 1). The inhibitory effects of EPA on iNOS activity were significantly (p<0.0001; two-way ANOVA with Sidak\u2019s multiple comparisons test, n=9) enhanced at all concentrations in the presence of diclofenac. By contrast, DHA did not significantly reduce LPS induced iNOS activity either in the absence or presence of diclofenac. Conclusions Our observations that EPA but not DHA reduced macrophage iNOS activity may contribute to our understanding of the reduced cardiovascular events as reported in the REDUCE-IT trial with an EPA only formulation. The ability of EPA to modulate macrophage activity has therapeutic implications for patients with cardiovascular risk."},

Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel effective interventions in the age\u2010related HFpEF. The plant-derived omega-3-fatty-acid \u03b1-linolenic-acid (ALA) has emerged to confer potential protective effects in cardiovascular disease. Our recent findings reveal that lifelong dietary ALA dampens thrombotic and cerebrovascular events in aged mice. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the reversal of age-related HFpEF phenotype by long-term nutritional ALA supplementation. Methods 6-month-old (young) wild-type C57BL/6J mice were fed a low, as control, or high ALA diet for more than 12 months. Here, we show that aged (>18 months) mice on low ALA diet recapitulate major hallmarks of HFpEF, including diastolic dysfunction with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, cardiac interstitial fibrosis, impaired acetylcholine-induced relaxation of aortic segments, and arterial stiffness. Results Intriguingly, we revealed that long-term ALA-rich diet reverses diastolic dysfunction, vascular relaxation capacity, reduced pulse wave velocity, interstitial cardiac fibrosis, and coincident hemodynamic abnormalities in aged mice. These findings are accompanied by blunting of inflammatory responses and a remarkable reduction in the expression of matrix-metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) by high ALA diet. Conclusions Our results demonstrate previously unrecognized protective effects of dietary ALA against impaired cardiovascular functional outcomes and cardiac structural changes typical of HFpEF in aged mice. Taken together, these data support the ALA-based nutritional intervention as a safe, plant derived and easily accessible therapeutic strategy for age-related HFpEF."},

However, these studies were prone to residual confounding and reverse causation, and thereby limit the ability for causal inference. We investigated the associations between genetically-determined antioxidant concentrations and ischemic stroke using Mendelian Randomization.  Methods For each circulating antioxidant (vitamin E, C, lycopene, \u03b2-carotene and retinol), which were assessed as absolute levels and/or metabolites, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were retrieved from earlier genomics studies and used as genetic instrument variables. We obtained summary statistics for gene-stroke associations from three European-ancestry cohorts (cases/controls): MEGASTROKE (67 162/454 450), UK Biobank (2404/368771) and FinnGen study (4026/90211). MR analyses were performed on each exposure per outcome database using inverse-variance weighted analyses, and subsequently meta-analyzed. Results In a combined sample of 986 964 individuals (73 592 cases), none of the genetically-determined absolute antioxidants or antioxidant metabolite concentrations were causally associated with the risk of ischemic stroke. For absolute antioxidants, the odds ratios (95% CI) ranged between 1.00 (95% CI: 0.99 to 1.01) for vitamin C and 1.06 (95% CI: 0.74 to 1.52) for retinol.

Whether adherence to dietary guidelines contributes to improved cognitive health remains unknown. Methods We tested whether non-adherence to national dietary guidelines was associated with risk of non-Alzheimer\u2019s dementia  \u2013  a dementia subtype related with vascular risk factors - and Alzheimer\u2019s disease in 94,184 individuals from the prospective Copenhagen General Population Study. As a positive control we tested whether non-adherence to dietary guidelines was associated with vascular diseases including ischemic cerebrovascular disease(ICVD) and ischemic heart disease(IHD). Results Low adherence to dietary guidelines was associated with an atherogenic lipid profile including significantly higher levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, remnant cholesterol and apoB(P-values from 9.3x10 -228  to 1.8x10 -8 ). We found that the hazard ratio for low adherence versus high adherence to dietary guidelines was 1.54(95% confidence interval 1.18-2.00) for non-Alzheimer\u2019s dementia in an age and sex adjusted model. In a multifactorial adjusted model, the corresponding value was 1.43(1.00-1.80). We did not observe any association with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. As expected, our positive control showed that low adherence to dietary guidelines was associated with significantly increased risk of ICVD and IHD in multifactorial adjusted models. Conclusions The present study provides evidence for preventing the part of dementia that is mainly due to vascular factors, and that focusing on implementation of national dietary guidelines will be of major importance for improved individual and public health."},

Rare loss of function (LOF) variants in apolipoprotein CIII have been reported to reduce triglycerides (TG) and decrease the risk of CAD in American Indians and Europeans. However, there is a paucity of data on whether these variants are cardioprotective in other European and non-European populations. Also, whether genetically increased TG due to ApoCIII is causally associated with increased CAD risk is still unclear and inconsistent.   Objective:  The goal of this study was to evaluate the causal association of genetically raised TG for increasing the risk for CAD and type 2 diabetes (T2D) using a Mendelian randomization approach. Methods Methods:  Using genome-wide genotypes and sequencing data of ten independent multiethnic cohorts comprising up to 397,460 individuals, we have evaluated the role of genetic variation in  APOCIII  for affecting circulating TG and the risk for developing CAD and T2D. Results Results:  Two common variants (rs5128 and rs734104) in the  APOCIII  were robustly associated with elevated TG across all cohorts showing an allelic risk-score p-value of 1.74x10 -674  in joint meta-analysis. A per risk allele-associated increase of TG of 12mmol/L \u00b1 SE 0.02mmol/L was predicted to enhance CAD risk by 5% 95%CI (3% to 6%; p=2.01x10 -05 ). On the contrary, the same TG raising variants reveal marginal protection from T2D (OR 0.99 95%CI 0.98-1.00; p=0.02). Conclusions Conclusions:  Our Mendelian randomization study suggests that the genetically regulated HTG via  APOCIII  may be causally associated with the increased risk for CAD."},

Recent studies also identified apoC-III as an inducer of sterile inflammation by activating the inflammasome, another CVD risk factor. It remains unclear if therapeutic apoC-III lowering can reduce CVD risk, nor is it clear if this is depended on lipid-lowering or anti-inflammatory properties or both. Methods In this study, we determined the impact of interventional apoC-III lowering on atherogenesis using an apoC-III antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) in hypertriglyceridemic mouse models where the intervention results in triglyceride-lowering ( Apoe -/- Ndst1 f/f Alb-Cre + ,  Ldlr -/- Ndst1 f/f Alb-Cre + ) or not ( Ldlr -/- Lrp1 f/f Alb-Cre + ). Results ApoC-III ASO treatment did not alter atherosclerotic lesion volume in the murine models mice simultaneously fed a Western diet. However, when triglyceride-lowering was obtained, apoC-III ASO treatment significantly attenuated advanced and unstable plaque development. In contrast, no improvement in lesion composition and hyperlipidemia was observed in apoC-III ASO-treated  Ldlr -/- Lrp1 f/f Alb-Cre +  mice. To mimic an intreventional setting we tested the impact of therapeutic apoC-III lowering in combination with a switch to a lipid-poor chow diet intervention after 12-week Western diet feeding. We observed that apoC-III ASO treatment significantly reduced atherosclerotic lesion size progression when an additive triglyceride-lowering was achieved. No differences in lesion development were observed in similarly treated  Ldlr -/- Lrp1 f/f Alb-Cre +  mice wherein no additive triglyceride-lowering was achieved by apoC-III ASO intervention. Conclusions Our data highlight that the impact of apoC-III on atherogenesis depends on its lipid-modifying properties. Hence, our findings suggest that interventional apoC-III lowering in hypertriglyceridemia patients can prevent plaques rupture and reduce CVD-associated mortality."},

Basic knowledge of VLDL assembly and the secretion pathway may help to find solutions for NAFLD.  Here, we present a novel gene,  SMLR1 , identified through contextual co-expression analysis  with APOC3 as anchor .  SMLR1  expression is strictly confined to liver and small intestine. Here, we present a first study on the role of SMLR1 in hepatic and plasma lipid metabolism. Methods Using somatic CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, we downregulated  Smlr1  expression in livers of wild-type male and female mice, fed a chow diet. Liver lipids were extracted, and VLDL secretion rate was assessed after poloxamer injection. Lipoprotein profiling was conducted by FPLC. Immortalized human hepatoma cells where used for localization studies.   Results Downregulation of  Smlr1  at the mRNA level (80%) and protein level (67%), resulted in 50% reduction of plasma cholesterol and triglycerides (p<0.001 for both), and increased hepatic lipid levels (>2.9fold, p<0.001). In line, VLDL secretion rate was reduced by 45% (Fig1A). Both LDL and HDL cholesterol were reduced (Fig1B). SMLR1 was found to be localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi complex. Conclusions Smlr1  is a key gene in the regulation of plasma and hepatic lipid metabolism. It is noteworthy that, until now, the phenotype resembles a phenocopy of the liver-specific MTTP-/- mice. SMLR1 is localized in the ER and Golgi complex and anticipated to play a role in the trafficking of lipoproteins."},

Since GIPR agonism stimulates lipolysis in white adipose tissue and GLP1R agonism promotes brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis, we hypothesized that combining GIPR and GLP1R agonism enhances the fatty acid (FA) flux to BAT to facilitate thermogenesis, thereby alleviating dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis development. Methods Dyslipidemic Western-type diet fed female APOE*3-Leiden.CETP mice were subcutaneously injected with either vehicle, a GIPR agonist (GIPFA-085; 300 nmol/kg/day), a GLP1R agonist (GLP-140; 30 nmol/kg/day) or both agonists for up to 10 weeks. Plasma triglyceride (TG) levels were measured, and TG-rich lipoprotein (TRL) metabolism was assessed using injection of glycerol tri[ 3 H]oleate and [ 14 C]cholesteryl oleate-labeled TRL-like particles. In the aortic valve region, atherosclerotic lesions were scored. Results GLP1R agonism lowered body weight (-2.0 g) and increased the uptake of VLDL-TG-derived FA by BAT (+157%) compared to vehicle. On these parameters concomitant GIPR and GLP1R agonism outperformed GLP1R agonism alone (body weight -2.8 g; VLDL-TG derived FA uptake by BAT +191%). Concomitant GIPR and GLP1R agonism, but not GLP1R agonism or GIPR agonism alone, tended to lower plasma TG levels (-46%) and markedly increased hepatic TRL-remnant uptake (+67%). Importantly, concomitant GIPR and GLP1R agonism decreased atherosclerotic lesion progression (-35% severe lesions). Conclusions Concomitant GIPR and GLP1R agonism stimulates TRL lipolysis and clearance more than the individual agonists and correspondingly attenuates atherosclerosis development. Current studies evaluate the effects of co-treatment on atherosclerosis in an obese setting."},

Regulatory T-cells (Treg) play a role as inflammation modulators in the atherosclerotic plaque environment and are highly sensitive to metabolic changes. Indeed, recent evidence has highlighted the central role of cholesterol and the mevalonate pathway in Treg functionality.   The aim of this study was to investigate the possible effect of hypolipidemia due to ANGPTL3 deficiency in modulating Treg distribution and characteristics. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from 5 FHBL2 subjects and 5 healthy sex and age -matched control subjects were analyzed by flow cytometry (FC). Tregs were gated as CD4 + /CD127 low /FOXP3 +  cells. HELIOS staining was used as a stability marker, whereas CD45RA -  was used as a marker of Treg cell activation. Cellular lipid content was analyzed through Bodipy staining. Results FHBL2 subjects showed an increased Treg fraction (7.80\u00b11.61% vs 4.52\u00b11.05 %,  P <0.01), with a stable effector phenotype. Percentages of circulating Tregs were inversely related to plasma levels of total (r=-0.7212;  P =0.023) and LDL cholesterol (r= -0.7818; p=0.0105). Bodipy staining highlighted a significantly lower lipid content in activated Tregs of FHBL2 subjects when compared to healthy controls (2613 average gMFI  vs . 2033 average gMFI,  P <0.05).

Methods Between 2007 and 2012, participants from the population-based Rotterdam Study with asymptomatic carotid wall thickening >2.5 mm on ultrasonography, were invited for carotid MRI. Among 1349 participants (mean age: 72 years, 49.5% women) without cardiovascular disease, we assessed plaque thickness, carotid stenosis (>30%), presence of intraplaque hemorrhage, lipid-rich necrotic core, and calcification. Follow-up for ASCVD was complete until January 1, 2015. Using Cox regression we fitted sex-specific prediction models including traditional cardiovascular risk factors (\u2018base\u2019 models), and calculated 5-year predicted risks of ASCVD. We extended the \u2018base\u2019 models by single and simultaneous additions of plaque characteristics, and calculated the c-statistics. Results The median predicted 5-year ASCVD risk based on cardiovascular risk factors was 5.3% in women and 9.5% in men. Intraplaque hemorrhage was a strong predictor of ASCVD in women (adjusted HR: 3.31, 95%CI=1.77-6.17). The c-statistic (95%CI) improved from 0.72 (0.65-0.78) to 0.76 (0.70-0.83) after single addition of intraplaque hemorrhage to the \u2018base\u2019 model. Simultaneous addition of plaque components, plaque thickness, and stenosis did not change these results. In men, carotid stenosis was associated with incident ASCVD (adjusted HR: 1.75, 95%CI=1.00-3.08), yet the association diminished after additionally adding other plaque characteristics, and no improvements were observed in c-statistics. Conclusions Presence of intraplaque hemorrhage is a strong predictor of ASCVD in women, independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, other plaque components, plaque size, and stenosis."},

Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) score could help to better stratify the risk of major cardiovascular events (MACE). We investigated the additional contribution of CAC Score to SAFEHEART risk equation (SAFEHEART-RE) for MACE prediction in HeFH. Methods We analyzed data from primary prevention HeFH patients undergoing CAC quantification from two ongoing national registries , REFERCHOL and SAFEHEART. CAC score was expressed as log(CAC + 1).We used probability-weighted Cox proportional hazard models to estimate hazard ratios (HR). Area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) and net reclassification improvement (NRI) were used to compare incremental contribution of CAC score to SAFEHEART-RE for MACE prediction. MACE were defined as coronary heart disease, stroke or transient ischemic attack, peripheral artery disease, resuscitated sudden death and cardiovascular death. Results We included 1424 patients (age 48.9\u00b112.8, men 45.9%).   After a 2.4-years follow-up, MACE occurred in 70 subjects. The addition of log(CAC+1) to SAFEHEART-RE was associated with an improved prediction of MACE in intermediate-risk (from HR 3.2 [95%CI 1.77-5.59] to HR 8.18 [95%CI 3.26-20.37]) and in high-risk subjects (from HR 3.5 [95%CI 1.93-6.30] to HR 20.21 [95%CI 8.58-47.6]) (log-rank p <0.0001). The c-statistics confirmed a significant improvement in MACE prediction by the addition of log(CAC+1) to SAFEHEART-RE (AUC 0.896 [0.889-0.903]) versus SAFEHEART-RE alone (AUC 0.859 [0.852-0.866]) (p= 0.004). The addition of CAC score was associated with an overall NRI of 46.8%.   Conclusions Identification of very-high risk HeFH patients is possible by combining information from SAFEHEART-RE and CAC score."},

Large-scale GWAS have identified hundreds of common variants for atherosclerotic disease and cardiovascular risk factors. One of the major challenges in the post-GWAS era remains decoding of susceptibility loci to targets that have the ability to translate into clinical care. Methods We developed a framework where we intersected scRNA-seq and GWAS summary statistics to offer a data driven guide towards disease relevant target identification. We performed gene-based association studies using GWAS summary statistics of atherosclerotic disease, cardiometabolic traits and other traits. We calculated a per cell population score to test for enrichment based on expression in individual cells of plaques of associated genes. Results We show that loci associated with coronary artery disease have a prominent substrate in plaque SMCs ( APOE ,  KANK2 ,  SORT1 ), ECs ( SLC44A1 ,  ATP2B1 ) and MCs ( APOE ,  HNRNPUL1 ), and coronary calcification loci risk loci are present in SMCs and ECs ( COL5A1 ,  YWHAE  and  MORF4L1 ). Considering plaque SMC-subtypes, risk loci for coronary calcification were enriched in synthetic SMCs. To assess the generalizability of our workflow, we applied our method to scRNAseq-data of liver and show that hepatocyte cell populations are enriched for circulating lipid-associated loci. Conclusions We present a data-driven guide to identify putative target genes in known susceptibility loci of cardiovascular traits that can be validated through functional testing in relevant cell types."},

There is accumulating evidence suggesting that colchicine might be beneficial in these patients with atherosclerosis however, its specific mechanism of action on plaque cells remains unclear. Methods Apolipoprotein E knockout mice (ApoE -/- ) on a high fat diet were treated with daily intraperitoneal injections of Colchicine or PBS for 16 weeks. The aorta was harvested for  en face  staining, immunostaining, and qPCR analysis. Human Peripheral Blood Monocytes (HPBM) and Human Coronary Artery Smooth Muscle Cells (HCASMC) from healthy donors were treated with Colchicine  In Vitro.  HPBM were also isolated from Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) patients and treated with Colchicine  In Vitro . Results Colchicine treated ApoE -/-  mice had decreased atherosclerotic plaque burden and lipid content on  en face  staining of the aorta. There was also a decrease in CD68 +  cells within atherosclerotic plaques. Colchicine treated mice also had lower pro-inflammatory transcript levels of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and MCP-1. LPS stimulated HPBM that were treated with Colchicine demonstrated a decrease in TNF-\u03b1 and MCP-1 gene and protein expression.  In Vitro  treatment of HCASMC with Colchicine demonstrated decreased cholesterol and oxidised LDL (ox-LDL) uptake as well as decreased IL-6 and MCP-1 transcript levels. There was also a reduction in HCASMC proliferation, migration and lipid uptake when cultured in Colchicine treated LPS-stimulated Monocyte secreted media from healthy controls and ACS patients.

However little is known about the reverse association i.e, whether vascular profile independently predicts increased cardiometabolic risks. We investigated the cross-sectional associations of carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV), a measure of arterial stiffness, and carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) with metabolic risks in young adulthood.   Methods We studied 1799 British 24.5-year-olds (62% females). cfPWV was measured by Vicorder device and cIMT by CardioHealth ultrasound scan. Insulin, glucose, lipid profile, and high sensitivity C-reactive protein were measured during a fasting state according to standard protocols. Using multivariable linear regressions we adjusted for age, sex, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, moderate to vigorous physical activity, smoking status, family history of cardiometabolic diseases, dual-energy Xray absorptiometry measured fat mass and lean mass, and other metabolic and inflammatory markers. Results cfPWV was directly and independently associated with fasting insulin concentration  [ \u03b2  = 0.202 (CI: 0.045 to 0.360); p=0.012]  and fasting plasma glucose [ \u03b2  = 0.656 (0.116 to 1.196); p=0.017].  cfPWV was not associated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride and high sensitivity C-reactive protein. cIMT was not associated with cardiometabolic and inflammatory markers. Conclusions These findings suggest that increased arterial stiffness independently associates with higher fasting insulin and glucose concentration in 24.5-year-olds. However, cIMT was unrelated to cardiometabolic risks. Future studies could examine the longitudinal associations of vascular properties in early life with cardiometabolic risks in adulthood."},

A total of more than 47,000 LA treatment data were collected.  Results All LA patients (n=930) showed an acute median reduction rate of 68.2% for LDL-C, and of 72.4% for Lp(a). Analogous to the Pro(a)LiFe pattern, incidence rate of major coronary events (MACE) 1 and 2 years before the beginning of LA treatment (y-2 and y-1) and prospectively seven years on LA treatment (y + 1 to y + 7) were analyzed. During the first two years of LA treatment (y+1 and y+2) a MACE reduction of 78% was observed and remained low prospectively (y+3 to y+7). LA patients with only increased Lp(a) levels (Lp(a) > 60 mg/dl (> 120 nmol/l); LDL-C < 100 mg/dl (< 2.6 mmol/l)) had a higher MACE reduction (84%; n=434) in the first two years of LA treatment compared to LA patients with only increased LDL-C-levels (LDL-C > 100 mg/dl (> 2.6 mmol/l); Lp(a) < 60 mg/dl (< 120 nmol/l)) (72%; n=175). Conclusions The data generated by the GLAR show that LA lowers the incidence rate of cardiovascular events in patients with high LDL-C and/or high Lp (a) levels, progressive ASCVD, and maximally tolerated lipid lowering medication.    The results are unique ."},

Methods This prospective observational cohort study enrolled adults \u226518 years old initiating evolocumab across 12 European countries from August 2015. The objectives were to describe clinical characteristics and LDL-C control among patients initiating evolocumab. We report data from patients with FH and follow up until July 2020. Results Of 1952 patients enrolled in HEYMANS, 766 (39%) had heterozygous (He) and 35 (1.8%) had homozygous (Ho) FH. Main diagnostic methods: Dutch lipid clinic network (40%), genetic testing (32%), LDL-C (19%). Mean age of FH patients, 57.2 (95% CI, 56.4-57.9) years; 56% male.

At evolocumab initiation, 45% of patients in the HeFH group were not receiving statins, 43% not receiving ezetimibe, 34% receiving high intensity statin+ezetimibe. Median (IQR) LDL-C in the HeFH group was 4.30 (3.39, 5.51) mmol/L at evolocumab initiation and dropped by 57% within 3 months; this reduction was maintained for up to 24 months (Figure 1). 55% of HeFH patients achieved an LDL-C <1.4 mmol/L following evolocumab initiation.   Conclusions In this large study of European clinical practice, a large proportion of HeFH patients initiating evolocumab were not receiving statins and had LDL-C above 4 mmol/L, despite meeting the ESC/EAS definition of very high CV risk. Following evolocumab initiation, median LDL-C fell by over half and this reduction maintained for up to 24 months."},

Methods We performed  18 F-NaF PET/CT in patients with mild to moderate AVS, and high versus low Lp(a) levels (> versus <50 mg/dl, respectively). Subjects were matched according to age, gender, peak aortic jet velocity, and valve morphology. We used a target-to-background ratio (TBR) with a most diseased segment (MDS) approach to compare  18 F-NaF-uptake between groups. Results A total of 52 individuals were included in the analysis. Mean age was 66.4\u00b15.5 years, 44 (84.6%) were men, and mean aortic valve velocity was 2.80\u00b10.49 m/s.

Methods We analyzed LDL aggregation susceptibility and HDL-apoA-I exchange to apoA-I ratio (HAE/apoA-I ratio), and activity of four proteins that regulate lipoprotein metabolism (CETP, LCAT, PLTP and PON1) in plasma samples derived from children with FH (n = 47) and from healthy children (n = 56). Potential biological mechanisms behind any variation in lipoprotein functionalities were explored using an NMR-based metabolomics profiling approach. Results LDL aggregation was higher and HAE/apoA-I ratio was lower in FH children than in healthy children. LDL aggregation associated positively with LDL-C and negatively with triglycerides, and HAE/apoA-I ratio associated negatively with LDL-C. Generally, the metabolomic profile for LDL aggregation was a mirror image of that for HAE/apoA-I ratio. Conclusions FH children displayed increased atherogenicity of LDL and disrupted HDL function. These newly observed functional alterations in LDL and HDL may help explain the risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in FH children."},

We investigated the relative impact of high ischemic risk (ESC/EACTS guidelines on myocardial revascularization definitions) versus high bleeding risk (PRECISE-DAPT score\u226525) on clinical outcomes after PCI. Methods A total of 10,167 consecutive patients undergoing PCI from prospective Fuwai PCI Registry were reviewed. ESC/EACTS\u2013HIR features was de\ufb01ned as having at least one of the eight clinical and angiographic characteristics. The primary ischemic endpoint was target vessel failure (cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction [MI], or target vessel revascularization [TVR]); bleeding outcome was assessed using the BARC type 2, 3, or 5 bleeding. Median follow-up was 29 months. Results Compared with non-HIR patients, HIR patients (n=5,149, 50.6%) were associated with increased risk for target vessel failure (adjusted hazard ratio [HR adjust ]: 1.48 [1.25-1.74]) and patient-oriented composite outcome (HR adjust : 1.44 [1.28-1.63]), as well as cardiac death, MI, and TVR. In contrast, the risk of clinically relevant bleeding was not signi\ufb01cantly different between the 2 groups. (HR adjust : 0.84 [0.66-1.06]). According to the definitions of PRECISE-DAPT score\u226525, HBR patients incurred an increased risk not only of bleeding but also of multiple ischemic events. There was no significant interaction between HBR status and clinical outcomes associated with ESC/EACTS-HIR criteria (all P interaction >0.05). Conclusions ESC/EACTS-high ischemic risk and high bleeding risk (PRECISE-DAPT score\u226525) were both significant predictors for ischemic clinical events in patients undergoing PCI. However, ESC/EACTS-high ischemic risk had a greater and more prolonged effect on outcomes than high bleeding risk (PRECISE-DAPT score \u2265 25)."},

Compare with other Europe regions. Methods Data were collected at a single visit for adults who consented to participate, with any LLT in the past 12 months and an LDL-C measurement in the past 14 months. Primary outcome was LDL-C goal attainment \u2265 28 days after starting the most recent lipid lowering therapy (stabilized LLT). Results Out of 5888 total subjects, 2154 were enrolled from six CEE countries: Czech Republic, n=509; Hungary, n=319; Poland, n=460; Romania, n=259; Slovakia, n=123; Ukraine, n=484. Mean (SD) age, 64 (11) years; 48% female. Of 1476 subjects on stabilized LLT at LDL-C measurement, 664 (45%) were primary prevention and 812 (55%) secondary prevention. 53% were receiving moderate intensity statin monotherapy; 32% receiving high intensity statin monotherapy and 5% receiving ezetimibe combination therapy. Mean (SD) LDL-C was 97 mg/dL (2.5 mmol/L). 44% and 24% of patients achieved their risk-based LDL-C 2016 and 2019 goals, respectively. Goal attainment in the CEE region was lower than observed in Northern and Western Europe (Figure 1).   Conclusions These data highlight a significant gap between guidelines and clinical practice for lipid management in the CEE region, with fewer than one-quarter of patients having LDL-C levels below the 2019 risk-based LDL-C goal. Risk-based goal attainment was lower than observed in Northern or Western Europe; combination therapy with non-statin LLT is needed to address this gap."},

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. Although NAFLD pathophysiology is not fully understood  alterations in fat metabolism seem to play a role. Autoantibodies against apolipoprotein A-1 (anti-apoA-1 IgG) are a novel cardiovascular risk factor  to which have been recently attributed a metabolic role and have a function as a disruptor of the cholesterol pathway.  This study aims at evaluating a possible role of anti-apoA-1 IgG in NAFLD. Methods Serum from 137 NAFLD patients were tested for anti-apoA-1 IgG prevalence.  In vitro , SREBP1, SREBP2 expressions were assessed in the human hepatic cell line HepaRG by western blot analysis and bodipy staining was used to evaluate the lipid droplet content. Oil Red O staining was used to detect lipid accumulation in liver sections from ApoE-/- mice.  Results Elevated anti-apoA-1 IgG seropositivity was found in patients with NAFLD (46%).  In vitro,  anti-apoA-1 IgG and not control IgG induced lipid accumulation in hepatic cells (5.9 vs 2.5, p=0.0008) and this lipid overload was associated with a high SREBP1 but not SREBP2 expression.  In vivo , anti-apoA-1 IgG and not control IgG also induced higher lipid accumulation in the livers of ApoE-/- mice (1.23 vs 0.53, p=0.03).  Conclusions Anti-apoA-1 IgG are frequent in NAFLD and promote lipid accumulation through SREBP1 activation. We hypothesize that anti-apoA1 IgG may be a potential driver in the development of NAFLD."},

Methods ApoE deficient (EKO) mice, apoE/apoA-I double deficient (DKO) mice, DKO mice overexpressing human apoA-I (DKO/hA-I) and wild-type mice were fed chow diet until 30 weeks of age. Plasma lipids were quantified, atherosclerosis development at the aortic sinus and in coronary arteries was measured, skin ultrastructure was evaluated by electron microscopy. Blood and lymphoid organs were characterized through histological, immunocytofluorimetric and whole transcriptome analyses. Results DKO mice were characterized by almost complete HDL deficiency and by plasma total cholesterol levels comparable to those of control mice. Only DKO mice showed xanthoma formation and severe inflammation in the skin-draining lymph nodes, whose transcriptome analysis revealed a dramatic impairment in energy metabolism and fatty acid oxidation pathways. An increased presence of CD4 +  T effector memory cells was detected in blood, spleen and in the skin-draining lymph nodes of DKO mice. A worsening of atherosclerosis at the aortic sinus and coronary arteries was also observed in DKO mice vs EKO mice. Human apoA-I overexpression in the DKO background was able to rescue the skin phenotype and to halt atherosclerosis development. Conclusions HDL deficiency, in the absence of hyperlipidemia, is associated with severe alterations of skin morphology, aortic and coronary atherosclerosis, local and systemic inflammation."},

In foam cells, autophagy was demonstrated to contribute to the degradation of lipid droplets (LDs) via a selective form of autophagy called lipophagy. Selective autophagy relies on tags such as ubiquitin and selectivity factors to label specific cargo for degradation. Yet, how LDs are targeted for autophagy remains poorly defined. Our study was aimed at identifying LD factors responsible for lipophagy in macrophage foam cells. Methods To identify lipophagy factors in macrophage foam cells in an unbiassed manner, we employed mass spectrometry to qualify the LD proteome. Using siRNA array in combination with high-content microscopy and cholesterol efflux screens, we assessed the functional role of these candidate lipophagy factors. Results We confirmed the presence of known LD-associated structural and metabolic proteins in the LD proteome. Additionally, we found the association of several proteins related to the ubiquitination machinery and autophagy, along with other novel factors that could regulate lipophagy. We observed that knocking down several of these genes, including  Maplc3b  and  Tfeb  significantly reduced cholesterol efflux, suggesting a role for these proteins in lipophagy-mediated LD catabolism. Furthermore, we identified optineurin as a novel cargo receptor for lipophagy. Conclusions Our study is the first to systematically identify several LD-associated proteins of the lipophagy machinery, a finding with important biological and therapeutic implications. Therapeutic targeting of these novel lipophagy factors may represent a means to enhance macrophage lipophagy to promote reverse cholesterol transport for the treatment of heart disease."},

Plasma lipid profiling, extensive immunophenotyping and histological analysis of the atherosclerotic plaques were then performed. Results TIR8 deletion in STD-fed LDLR KO mice impacts circulating immune cell profile: decreased percentage of T lymphocytes (-29%, p<0.001) and increased percentage of B cells (+14%, p<0.05) were observed compared to LDLR KO mice, as well as increased mature Natural Killer cells (+13%, p<0.0001), as already described in the TIR8 KO mouse model. When fed a cholesterol rich diet for 12 weeks to induce atherosclerosis, in addition to changes observed on STD, also circulating levels of monocytes increased in DKO mice compared to LDL-R KO mice (mean 1464 vs 910 cells/ul, p<0.05). These changes in immune profile, however, did not affect atherosclerotic plaque area or stability. Similarly, no differences in plasma lipid profile were observed.

One of the most frequent dyslipidaemias is familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), which is mostly caused by mutations in the  LDL receptor  ( LDLr) . Although an early identification is essential to reduce premature mortality, only the 10 % of FH patients are properly diagnosed.   In vitro  characterization of variants is time consuming and expensive, so computational predictors of pathogenicity of mutations are under constant development. The aim of our work was to create a machine learning-based model that can predict the pathogenicity of  LDLr  missense variants, the most common ones, on an easy and reliable way. Methods Using more than 700  LDLr  missense variants characterized on ClinVar database and Excel solver Evolutionary algorithm, we created a Machine Learning model that predicts the pathogenicity of a variant based on seven characteristics of the mutated amino acid: Conservation of the residue, original and substituting amino acid, hydrophobicity, size, charge and affected domain.   We used a part of the dataset as training group for the obtention of pathogenicity frequency distribution and other essential parameters. Then, the model was tested with the other part of the dataset, the validation group. Results MLb-LDLr shows a sensitivity of 92.5% and a specificity of 91.5%, matching or even surpassing other predictor software such as PolyPhen-2 or SIFT. Conclusions With an accuracy higher than 90%, we conclude that  in silico  predictions are a reliable source of information about  LDLr  variant pathogenicity."},

Tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP), the main enzyme involved in bone mineralization, is expressed in calcified mouse plaques, and is also elevated in the blood of individuals with metabolic syndrome, in whom it is associated with cardiovascular mortality. Therefore, we aimed to determine the involvement of TNAP in plaque calcification and progression. Methods TNAP activity was studied in aortic plaques, liver and blood of apoE-deficient mice fed a high fat diet from 10 weeks of age and sacrificed every two weeks from 17 to 31 weeks. Plaque calcification was imaged longitudinally with  18 F-NaF PET and \u00b5CT and histologically with the calcium tracer osteosense. TNAP expression was also investigated in calcified and non-calcified human carotid plaques. TNAP was inhibited in mice using the inhibitor SBI-425 (30 mg/kg/day) from 10 weeks of age. Results Plaque calcification developed as cartilage metaplasia in association with TNAP activity in apoE-deficient mice. In human carotid plaques, calcification was also localized to TNAP-positive areas. In mice, short-term SBI-425 treatment prevented early plaque calcification, reduced inflammation, plaque growth and lipid accumulation, without exerting adverse effects on bone architecture. More unexpectedly, TNAP inhibition reduced serum cholesterol and triglycerides, suggesting that TNAP may slow down plaque development through direct and indirect effects. Conclusions In conclusion, this study demonstrates that TNAP activity strongly impacts plaque development, by effects probably not restricted to plaque calcification."},

Whether this is also true for Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) is not known. We tested the hypothesis that elevated remnant cholesterol is associated with increased risk of PAD. Methods A total of 107,169 individuals from the Copenhagen General Population Study examined in 2003\u20132015 were included in a prospective, observational association study. During 15 years of follow-up, 1,587 individuals were diagnosed with PAD. Hazard ratios were estimated using Cox regression models. Results were independently confirmed in 13,972 individuals from the Copenhagen City Heart Study examined in 1976-78, with 1,033 cases of PAD diagnosed during 43 years of follow-up. Results Higher levels of remnant cholesterol were associated with a stepwise increase in the risk of PAD up to a multivariable adjusted hazard ratio of 3.1 (95% confidence interval: 2.2-4.2) for individuals with remnant cholesterol concentrations \u22651.5 mmol/l compared to individuals with remnant cholesterol <0.5 mmol/l. Corresponding results for myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke were 2.6 (2.0-3.4) and 1.6 (1.3-2.0). Cumulative incidence of PAD at age 80 ranged from 2.9% in individuals with remnant cholesterol <0.5 mmol/l to 8.9% in individuals with remnant cholesterol \u22651.5 mmol/l (Figure). Results in the Copenhagen City Heart Study were similar.   Conclusions Elevated remnant cholesterol is associated with a 3-fold increased risk of PAD, higher than for myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke. Clinical trials should evaluate the effect of remnant cholesterol lowering therapy in the context of PAD."},

Postprandial hypertriglyceridemia and changes in remnant-like lipoprotein particles are well recognized in T2D, but the metabolism and /or clearance of these triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TGRL) is less clear. The interstitial fluid (IF) represents the immediate environment of most cells in the body and studying postprandial changes in this compartment should provide novel insights into the increased cardiovascular risk observed in T2D. Methods Five T2D patients with adequate control of diabetes and matched healthy controls were given a standardized meal (1270 kcal; 70/31g fat/saturated fat; 96/60g carbohydrates/sugar, 64g protein) after fasting overnight. Serum was collected hourly for 9h following meal, and IF was harvested through skin blisters at 3 timepoints (TP1=0-3h, TP2=3-6h, TP3=6-9h). Analyses of serum and IF TG, TGRL and lipoprotein lipids were determined by FPLC and ELISA. Results T2D patients exhibited typical serum dyslipidemia patterns, with elevated fasting TG followed by delayed and prolonged postprandial response. In IF, significant accumulation of TGs was observed postprandially for both T2D and controls. T2D displayed increased interstitial TGRL and lower HDL in all TPs which became even more pronounced in the later collections (p<0.05). Reduced IF-to-serum ratio of TG was seen at all TPs (p<0.05), VLDL-TG TP3 (p<0.05) and HDL-TG TP1+3 (p<0.05) in T2D.   Conclusions By exploring the postprandial response in the interstitial compartment, we have identified a dysregulated and protracted metabolism of TGRL in T2D. We are currently exploring whether this is accompanied by an abnormal clearance of these pro-atherogenic particles."},

MicroRNAs (small non-coding RNAs) are negative regulators of gene expression and creation of new biding sites can be the cause of hypercholesterolaemia in mutation-negative families. The present work aims to analyse miRNAs targets as regulators of genes involved in lipid metabolism in FH patients. Methods A sample of 180 mutation-negative individuals (FH negative) was re-sequenced using NGS and the 3\u2019UTR regions of  LDLR ,  APOB  and  PCSK9  were analysed. miRNA-SNP database was used to predict target gain or loss of miRNA:mRNA binding sites disturbed by SNPs in the 3'UTR. Two groups of samples were additionally sequenced, 174 FH mutation-positive individuals and 143 normolipidemic individuals. Results Preliminary results show that 99% of the FH negative individuals present 2 SNPs predicted to gain 2 miRNA targets in the  LDLR  3\u2019UTR. Gain of these miRNA target-binding sites might negatively regulate  LDLR  gene expression in the liver. We have also identified 1 SNP (1 individual) predicted to lose a miRNA target in the  APOB  3\u2019UTR and 4 SNPs (14 individuals) predicted to lose miRNAs targets in the  PCSK9  3\u2019UTR. Loss of miRNA target-binding sites in  APOB  and  PCSK9  3\u2019UTRs can contribute to a higher expression of these genes in the liver. FH positive and normolipidemic cohorts are being analysed.  Conclusions We have identified several SNPs that predict to gain/lose miRNAs target-binding sites that might explain the hypercholesterolaemia in FH mutation-negative."},

In addition, apoM deficiency is associated with increased vascular permeability and brown adipose tissue (BAT) mass and activity, and these effects are partly mediated by the S1P receptor 1. Methods In the current study, we explored the connection between plasma apoM/S1P levels and parameters of BAT as measured via 18F-FDG PET/CT after cold exposure using three different protocols in humans. Results Fixed (n=15) vs personalized (n=20) short-term cooling protocols decreased and increased apoM (-8.4%, p=0.032 vs 15.7%, p<0.0005) and S1P (-41.0%, p<0.0005 vs 19.1%, p<0.005) plasma levels, respectively. Long-term cooling (n=44) had no effect on plasma apoM or S1P levels. Plasma apoM and S1P did not correlate significantly to BAT volume and activity in the individual study using fixed or personalized cooling protocols. The short-term studies combined, showed that increased changes in plasma apoM correlated with BAT volume (\u03b2:0.39, 95% CI [-0.01-0.78], P=0.054) and metabolic activity (\u03b2:0.44, 95% CI [0.06-0.81], P=0.024) after adjusting for study design.  Conclusions Plasma apoM and S1P levels are altered in response to cold exposure and may be linked to changes in BAT metabolic activity and volume.

Plasma A8 levels are associated with indices of glucose and TG metabolism, but the causality of these relationships and the contribution of genetic variants to inter-individual differences in A8 levels has not been investigated. Methods To address these questions, we developed a sensitive and specific A8 ELISA and measured plasma A8 levels in the Dallas Heart Study (DHS), a large multiethnic population-based cohort. Results The distribution of fasting A8 levels was highly skewed to the right with a median (IQR) of 13.3 (6.8\u201323.1) ng/mL. A8 levels did not differ significantly across age groups or genders. Remarkable differences were found among racial/ethnic groups with Blacks having significantly higher A8 levels than either Hispanics or Whites. A8 levels correlated with BMI, fasting glucose, insulin and TG levels. Exome-wide association study revealed a strong association between the minor T-allele of the A8(R59W) variant with plasma A8 levels. After adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity and BMI, the A8(59W) variant explained ~17% of the inter-individual variation in A8 levels. This variant was not associated with any of the metabolic parameters correlated with plasma A8 concentrations despite resulting in a 4-fold increase in A8 levels. Conclusions A8 levels are a consequence, not the cause, of the associated metabolic phenotypes."},

Besides the pro-atherogenic properties of the LDL- like moiety, Lp(a) further contributes to the disease pathology by carrying pro-inflammatory oxidized phospholipids (OxPLs). While blocking these OxPL epitopes profoundly reduces the monocytic inflammatory response, a residual inflammatory risk remains. Methods To determine the contributing factors resulting in this residual inflammation, we performed lipidomics on complete plasma from healthy individuals with either elevated [median 87 mg/dL (218 nmol/L); N=12]or low [median 7 mg/dL (18 nmol/L); N=13] levels of Lp(a). Results Using this unbiased lipidomics approach, we discovered a distinct \u201clipidome\u201d in individuals with elevated Lp(a) levels as displayed by an upregulation of several diacylglycerol species (DAGs) and lysophosphatic acid (LPA). Further fractionation and purification of different lipoprotein fractions showed that these DAGs are preferentially carried by Lp(a). Next, we functionally assessed if these upregulated DAGs are able to elicit an inflammatory response in monocytes. Upon  ex vivo  DAG stimulation, monocytes elicited a dose dependent increase in IL-8, IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 secretion. Functionally, our preliminary data demonstrated this coincided with increased transendothelial migration. Conclusions By using transwell migration assays with fluorescently labelled monocytes, combined with sprouting assays and in-depth phosphorylation analysis, we aim to further characterise the pathways effected by DAGs and LPA to further unravel the atherogenicity of Lp(a) and will be available at the EAS 2021."},

This project aimed at investigating whether PCSK9 regulates lipoprotein receptors expression in the heart, thus modulating heart metabolism and cardiac function. Methods Pcsk9 KO, Albumin CRE PCSK9LoxP/LoxP conditional KO) and double LDLr-Pcsk9 KO male mice undewent an extensive characterization for heart function followed by heart metabolomics and proteomic profiling. Results Pcsk9 KO hearts presented heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, reduced running resistance without muscular defects coupled to major adaptations in cardiac metabolism and mitochondrial functionality. This profile was associated with lipid accumulation in the heart. Moreover PCSK9 deficiency resulted in the accumulation of carnitine-conjugated fatty acid (C8; 0,066\u00b10,047 Vs0,195\u00b10,035 and C12; 0,021\u00b10,018Vs0,11\u00b10,069 pg/ug of prot, p<0,05) which was paralleled by a reduction of glucose 6-P, ribose-5P and erythrose-4P levels in the heart, suggesting a shift from fatty acid oxidation toward anaerobic glycolysis. Also Krebs cycle intermediates were reduced compared to WT samples. A similar phenotype was observed in LDLr Double KO confirming an effect independent of LDLr expression. The cardiac phenotype was reverted in the liver selective KO model thus excluding the involvement of circulating PCSK9 in the development of HFpEF observed in full KO mice. Translational studies showed that human subjects carrying the R46L loss of function polymorphism displayed increased left ventricular mass without alterations in ejection fraction compared to R46R BMI-matched controls. Conclusions These data suggest that PCSK9 deficiency impacts cardiac lipid metabolism indepedently of LDLR modulation and promotes the development of HFpEF."},

Membrane endoglin (Eng) is shown to participate in fibrosis, and plasma concentrations of soluble endoglin (sEng) are increased in patients with hypercholesterolemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus. We hypothesize that NASH increases both hepatic Eng expression and sEng in blood, and that high levels of sEng modulate cholesterol and bile acid (BA) metabolism and affect NASH progression. Methods Three-month-old transgenic male mice overexpressing human sEng and their wild type littermates are fed for six months with either a high-saturated fat, high-fructose high-cholesterol (FFC) diet or a chow diet. Evaluation of NASH, LC-MS analysis of BA, hepatic expression of Eng, inflammation, fibrosis markers, enzymes and transporters involved in hepatic cholesterol and BA metabolism are assessed using qRT-PCR and Western blot. Results The FFC diet significantly increased mouse sEng levels and hepatic expression of Eng. High levels of human sEng resulted in increased hepatic deposition of cholesterol due to reduced conversion into BA, as well as redirected the metabolism of triglycerides (TAG) to its accumulation in the liver, via reduced TAG elimination by beta-oxidation combined with reduced hepatic efflux. Conclusions We propose that sEng might be a biomarker of NASH development, and the presence of high levels of sEng might support NASH aggravation by impairing the essential defensive mechanism protecting NASH liver against excessive TAG and cholesterol accumulation, suggesting the importance of high sEng levels in patients prone to develop NASH.

Recent studies show that the balance of M1/M2 plays an important role in atherosclerotic plaque stability. miR-125a-3p can regulate the differentiation of monocytes to M1 type macrophages. In our previous study , the expression of miR-125a-3p was significantly increased in patients with acute coronary syndrome. This study is to investigate the effect of miR-125a-3p inhibitor on the atherosclerotic plaque formation, M1/M2 macrophages, MMP-2 and VEGF in atherosclerotic plaque in vivo. Methods Cholesterol-fed rabbits were applied to study the effect of miR-125a-3p inhibitor on atherosclerotic plaque, the area of atherosclerotic plaque was measured by image analysis after oil red O staining, MMP-2 and VEGF were measured by immunohistochemistry, and the M1 marker CD11c and M2 marker CD206 were detected by immunofluorescence in plaque tissue.

Methods EAT was obtained after heart surgery from non-diabetic (ND) and diabetic patients, referred as DM-C or DM according to the presence or not of coronary disease. EAT explants were incubated for 24 h, and the secretomes were added to AC16 human cardiomyocytes in the presence or absence of HDL or apoJ.

Results Viridans streptococcal DNA was found in 42.1% of autopsy coronary plaques and in 42.9% of clinical endarterectomy samples. Of coronary samples, 218/360 (60.6 %) and of available surgical endarterectomies, 30/59 (52.5 %) were immunopositive for viridans streptococci, associating (p<0.0001) with severity of atherosclerosis. Streptococci colonized as a biofilm the necrotic core of atheromas, unrecognized by innate immune system. Phenotypically virulent streptococci, dispersed from the biofilm infiltrated the fibrous caps of atheromas co-localizing with the expression of pattern recognizing receptors and molecules of adaptive immunity.

This process can be triggered by cold exposure, caloric excess, and the immune system. Recently thermogenesis has been associated with plasma lipoprotein transport system. Specifically, APOE3 is shown to have a bimodal effect on WAT thermogenesis while APOE2 and APOE4 differentially affect BAT and WAT thermogenesis in processes highly modulated by APOA1. Furthermore, APOA1 deficiency is associated with no measurable UCP1 levels in WAT of mice fed high fat diet. Methods Based on these observations here we sought to investigate the potential roles of APOA1 and APOE3 in BAT and WAT metabolic activation in mice, following    a 2-week stimulation by cold exposure  (7 o C) .  Results Our data showed that APOA1 deficiency ablated BAT and WAT mitochondrial metabolic response to cold stimuli. Ectopic expression of APOA1 in  Apoa1 -/-  mice exposed to 7 o C, resulted in virtually undetectable levels of APOE-containing HDL and only BAT thermogenesis induction. On the contrary, WAT mitochondria responded to cold stimuli only under the concomitant expression of both APOA1 and APOE3 in these mice. Conclusions In conclusion, APOA1-containing HDL promotes BAT thermogenesis in the presence of very low levels of APOE3-containing HDL, which acts as an inhibitor in this process. In contrast, induction of WAT thermogenesis is subjected to a more complicated regulation which requires the presence of both APOA1- and APOE3-containing HDL."},

Methods W e investigated chromatin accessibility profiles of the human atherosclerotic lesions using single nucleus (sn)ATAC-Seq to map cell type-specific patterns of CREs, to understand transcription factors establishing cell identity and to interpret CAD-relevant, non-coding genetic variation. Results We identified specific transcription factors associated with macrophage subtypes and the differentiation trajectory of smooth muscle cells transitioning into fibromyocytes. We demonstrate that endothelial and smooth muscle cell enhancers are particularly enriched for blood pressure and CAD associated genetic variants. We prioritized putative target genes and candidate regulatory elements for ~30% of all the CAD loci using single cell co-accessibility and  cis -eQTL information. Finally, we performed genome-wide experimental fine-mapping of the CAD GWAS variants using epigenetic molecular QTL analysis in primary human aortic endothelial cells and STARR-Seq massively parallel reporter assay in smooth muscle cells. This analysis identified potential causal SNP(s) and the associated target gene for over 30 CAD loci. We present several examples where the chromatin accessibility and gene expression could be assigned to one cell type predicting the cell type of action for CAD loci.

CHIP mutations double the risk of CAD and are associated with worse overall survival. Our research aims to understand how CHIP mutations change the myeloid cell biology and contribute to atherosclerosis. Methods We screened 812 patients admitted for left heart coronary angiography in University Heart Center Freiburg and conducted targeted genomic sequencing to identify CHIP carriers. We applied single\u2011cell gDNA/mRNA parallel sequencing to perform intra\u2011individual comparison of gene expression in monocytes carrying DNMT3A H882 hotspot mutation and that in non\u2011mutated monocytes. Results The prevalence of CHIP mutation was at least two times higher in all age groups of our cohort than that of general population. Middle\u2011aged (age of 40 to 69) patients with mutations in the two most common CHIP genes, DNMT3A and TET2, had significantly higher burden of CAD than those without CHIP mutations. Single\u2011cell RNA profiling revealed that monocytes with DNMT3A H882C mutation formed separate clusters and distinctively increased the expression of genes that regulate IFN\u03b3, IL\u20116, IL\u201112, and TNF production or response. Genes regulating monocyte chemotaxis was not differentially expressed in mutated monocytes. Conclusions We confirmed the enhanced risk of CAD associated with CHIP mutations. With single\u2011cell gDNA/RNA parallel sequencing, we demonstrated the direct effect of CHIP mutation on monocyte biology, avoiding inter\u2011individual variation. DNMT3A H882C mutation altered gene expression of monocytes and activated pro\u2011inflammatory pathways without noticeable influences on monocyte chemotaxis."},

Prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) initiate cellular hypoxic responses, possibly influencing macrophage function in plaque hypoxia. Thus, we elucidated the role of myeloid PHDs in atherosclerosis. Methods Myeloid specific PHD knockout (PHDko) mice were fed high cholesterol diet for 6-12 weeks to induce atherosclerosis. Plaque parameters, e.g. plaque size and macrophage content, were analyzed. Bulk and single cell RNA sequencing was performed on PHD2 BMDMs and plaque macrophages, respectively. Results Aortic root plaque size was augmented 2.6fold in PHD2cko, and 1.4-fold in PHD3ko, but not in PHD1ko mice compared to controls. Macrophage apoptosis was promoted in PHD2cko and PHD3ko mice  in vitro  and  in vivo,  via the HIF1\u03b1/BNIP3 axis. Bulk and single cell RNA data of PHD2cko bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) and plaque macrophages, respectively, confirmed these findings and were validated by siRNA silencing. Human plaque BNIP3 mRNA associated with plaque necrotic core, suggesting similar adverse effects. Further, PHD2cko plaques displayed enhanced fibrosis, independent of macrophage and SMC function. PHD2cko BMDMs enhanced fibroblast collagen secretion in a paracrine manner and  in silico  analysis of macrophage-fibroblast communication predicted SPP1 signaling as regulator, in line with enhanced plaque SPP1 protein content, and SPP1mRNA in TREM2-foamy plaque macrophages,  but not in neutrophils. Conclusions Myeloid PHD2cko and PHD3ko enhanced plaque growth, macrophage apoptosis, and PHD2cko activated paracrine collagen secretion by fibroblasts. PHD1 did not seem paramount in myeloid cells in atherogenesis."},

The epitope of the antibodies elicited by the PC-Vaccine coincides with that of 'natural' anti-pneumococcal antibodies and strikingly similar results can be obtained by vaccination with Prevenar\u00ae.   The aim of the present study was therefore to assess whether the atheroprotective effects carried by PC-Vaccine and Prevenar@ are linked to the activation of the germline encoded B cell pool, which is responsible for the production of natural antibodies. Methods AID Cre mice were crossed with ApoEKO mice and double transgenic mice were immunized with PC-Vaccine or with Prevenar\u00ae as previously reported (DOI:10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2018.06.903). Three months later, atherosclerotic lesions and natural anti-PC IgM antibodies values were compared to the AID+ (affinity maturated) IgM+ (B1-like) cell pool in the peritoneal cavity and draining lymph nodes. Results Discriminant analysis showed that the rise of natural anti-PC IgM antibodies (AB1-2 IgM), the proportion of affinity matured (AID+) B1-like cells (CD19+ CD5+ CD43+ CD1d+ IgM+) having migrated from the draining lymph node to the peritoneal cavity and the lesion size (AUC) were interdependent from each other and that atheroprotection in both PC-Vaccine and Prevenar\u00ae mouse groups was proportional to the fraction of affinity matured B1-like cells in the peritoneal cavity and the rise of natural anti-PC IgM antibody production (individual data and bivariate plots are displayed in the figure).   Conclusions Phosphorylcholine-targeting vaccination boosts affinity maturation of B lymphocytes involved in the production of natural antibodies and prevents experimental atherosclerosis progression."},
